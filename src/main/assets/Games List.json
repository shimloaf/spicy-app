    "tips": [
      "Try and be very physical while performing the scene! It's much easier to remember big physical events than exact lines of dialogue, and the audience will catch on with the gimmick quicker!",
      "It's okay if you don't remember every word. Holding onto a key phrase that the audience will remember is usually enough to keep the game going!"

      "A good way to play this game with three players is by having the third player start off on the sidelines, and then enter the scene at about halfway through the scene. That way, you can easily define a pivotal moment in the scene, for free!",
      "An interesting add-on to try at the end of the normal sequence of scene halving is to try and play out the scene in reverse. Since doing a scene in reverse requires you to remember a lot of the same things as this game, it's not uncommon to see them combined!"
