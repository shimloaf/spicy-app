      "Try and be very physical while performing the scene! It's much easier to remember big physical events than exact lines of dialogue, and the audience will catch on with the gimmick quicker!",
      "It's okay if you don't remember every word. Holding onto a key phrase that the audience will remember is usually enough to keep the game going!"
