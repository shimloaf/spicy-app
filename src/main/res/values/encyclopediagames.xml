    <string-array name="encyclopediagames">
        <item name="ACE">One players tells a story, solo. 3 other players tag the player if they want to hear more action (narrative), more emotion or more color. By color we mean environmental detail, as in how does it smell, temperature, weather, colors, sounds.\n\n Also known as ACE. - for Action, Color, Emotion.</item>
        <item name="AcceptingCircle">Get everyone in a big circle. One player starts by making a little gesture, perhaps with a little sound. His or her neighbor then tries and does exactly the same. And so on. Although we expect the gesture/sound not to change, it will.\n\n Watch for movements that suddenly change left/right arm or leg. This is not really supposed to happen, but it will. Once happened, it should be accepted by the next player.\n\n Also watch/listen for little moans or sighs that players might make before or after their turn - these should also be taken over by the next player.</item>
        <item name="ActionSyllables">Great warm-up that also helps a new group to learn each other\'s names. Everyone in a circle. First person says his name, making a gesture (an action) for every syllable. Mary has 2 syllables, so she does something like Ma- (wave right hand) -ry (claps in hands). Everyone repeats this. Then the second person calls his name, again with a gesture per syllable. Group repeats, and then repeats all previous names and syllables.</item>
        <item name="ActorSwitch">A scene is started, played by 2 to 4 players. Mid-scene the MC interrupts, and all characters are replaced by new players. The new players should take over the original characters, and stick to the story that was being developed.\n\n Also known as Understudy.</item>
        <item name="ActorsNightmare">This one is played by 2 players, one of which gets their lines on paper (like a script). The other player should justify whatever the scripted player says.\n\n You can use existing plays for this, but also lines from comics. Whoever gets the script should not forget to play/act - only her lines are defined, not what she does, or how she does the lines.\n\n Also known as Playbook. See Don\'t Mess with Textus for a similar handle.</item>
        <item name="AdjectiveScene">Ask for an adjective (e.g. sad). Play a scene in which the players are as sad as possible. Alternatively, give every player a different adjective.</item>
        <item name="AdvancingAndExpanding">Simple exercise, useful for players that are too verbal. One player starts a scene. As soon as the trainer claps his hands, the player needs to make whatever he was doing more interesting, without advancing. If our player was opening a briefcase at the clap, he needs to make \'opening a briefcase\' more interesting; he is not allowed to take something out of the briefcase, as that would be advancing; player needs to stick to opening the briefcase.\n\n Simple to explain but not so easy to play. When done well you move into the clownesque. Think about Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or Mr. Bean.\n\n As a variation, at a second clap, allow the player to advance the scene. Also known as Make More Interesting.</item>
        <item name="Aerobics">This is a fun observation game. Place all players in a line. The first player starts walking around the room, walking a large circle. The second player starts following the first one, and tries to move like the first player. After a few rounds, the first player goes to the back of the line, and the third player starts following and imitating the second one.\n\n Tell players to be themselves; don\'t try and walk around funny (it\'s not the Ministry of Silly Walks after all).</item>
        <item name="AhabAndTheWhale">Get 3 rules from the audience, e.g. players have only one arm, players can\'t use a word that contains an \'s\' and after every question uttered players needs to yell \'Yess!\'. Players then play a scene, obeying the 3 rules. For examples of what else might be used as a rule see the other games in the Limitations category. Also known as 3 Rules.</item>
        <item name="Airplane">One player is blindfolded, and the room is filled with obstacles (put a couple of chairs everywhere, leave all kinds of junk on the floor). The idea is that the rest of the group will lead the blindfolded player through the room, by talking.\n\n A helpful reader offered us an explanation for the name \'Airplane\': The blindfoldee (or just eyes closed) is led through a maze composed of furniture and the other actors. He is an Airplane lost in the fog being talked down by the Air Traffic Controller, who must remain in his/her Tower. Standing on a chair/rehearsal block lends visibility for the controller. The airplane also only has a limited amount of fuel left (1â€“3 minutes, whatever) to reach a safe landing (arriving at the Tower). The airplane is also allowed two brushes-limited contact with an obstacle. The third brush or a direct hit or stepping on something directly causes a crash. They may step around, over or under the obstacles. Also, the airplane can only fly forward. It can turn in any direction, however. The directions must be given from the pilot\'s point of view; a good exercise for fledgling directors. You can also destroy all the trust you\'ve built up in your class by completely clearing the deck and torturing the Pilot. Believe us, someone will suggest it.\n\n Also known as Obstacle Course. Also known as Mine Field. Also known as Blind Lead. See also Fingertips for a similar exercise.</item>
        <item name="AliBabaAndThe40Thieves">Excellent warm-up. Everyone in a circle. We are going to establish a rhythm, by saying, all together Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves. Keep repeating this.\n\n One person starts making a gesture to this rhythm, say, tapping your head with you left hand. When the sentence is repeated, the player next to her takes over this gesture, while the first one starts a completely different new gesture. Third time the sentence is done, player three does the first gesture, player two does the second gesture and player one invents a new one again. And so on.\n\n This is also a concentration game, though it\'s not really difficult. All one has to do is watch the previous player, and next time, take over her gesture. When you\'re watching what everyone else is doing you\'re going to get lost though.</item>
        <item name="AlienTigerCow">Fun game to warm up and to teach players some Chivalry. Everyone in a circle. There are 3 things a player can be:\n An alien: hold you index fingers up next to your head, as little antennas and say Bleeb bleeb, bending inwards into the circle;\n A cow: bend forward, hold your right hand on your tummy and go Moooo\n A tiger: push your right hand forward, imitating a claw and roar.\n\n On your sign, every player decides to become one of the three. The idea is for everyone to become the same, which obviously won\'t be the case, the first time. We re-do this until everyone is in sync.\n\n As a variation, invent your own animals (or things) and let players become juke boxes, birds, whatever.\n Try playing majority wins: animals/things that are most in the minority drop out. Also known as Rock Paper Scissors.</item>
        <item name="Alliances">4 players play a scene, in which one of the players gets excluded. This is a group exercise, in the sense that players should be sensing where the majority of the group is going (see Alien Tiger Cow ). Tell players not to be afraid of \'being nasty\' - be extreme in your exclusion (that makes it easier, also for the player that is excluded - see Mr. Nice Guy ). Whoever gets excluded should gladly accept this and react accordingly. Excluded players can go to extremes to be re-included - hilariously funny if even this is thoroughly ignored by the others.\n\n Let the exclusion evolve; allow a player that got excluded to get 2 others to join him and exclude the fourth one. This only works if the excluded player first allows herself to be excluded (a little Chivalry here).\n\n Also known as Alliances. . This game was originally created as a pattern game for long form shows at the Theatresports London Impro Lab in the late 1980\'s. The whole point of the game is NOT to actively try and exclude anyone. The exclusion of one player should happen as a result of the other players making alliances with one another. If you don\'t do this the scene doesn\'t form very good patterns and the players get too competitive. You also miss the slow, sliding status drops and the desperate attempts to hook into an existing alliance, that happen when a player is starting to nrealize that they are being excluded.\n\n A good way to start this game would be:\n Start in a black-out seated round a table\n While the lights are still down the entire ensemble starts to laugh (as if someone has just told the punchline to a hilarious joke)\n The lights slowly fade up as the cast\'s laughter winds down and the alliances begin to form\n By the end of the scene, which climaxes in a final, dramatic exclusion, we usually end up with four to six threads and a clear protagonist\n Big thanks to Alan Marriott of Crunchy Frog Collective and Grand Theft Impro (London, England) for the additional info on Excluding.</item>
        <item name="AlliterationIntroduction">Excellent game for players to get to know each other\'s names. Everyone in a circle. A player starts the game by introducing himself by making a gesture, and alliterating to his name, e.g. I\'m Wonderful Wendy or I\'m Smart Steve. The next player point to the first, repeats the previous player\'s name, attribute and gesture, and does something similar about himself.\n\n And so on. Game ends with the first player having to do each other player\'s gesture, repeating their names and attributes.</item>
        <item name="Alliterations">You will need a tennis ball or a towel tied in a knot for this one. Everyone sitting or standing in a circle. You give one person the ball, and ask him to name as many words as possible that start with a \'P\' (or any other letter), in the time it takes for the ball to get passed along the circle. Doubles don\'t count, obviously.\n\n Tell players not to watch the ball go round when they\'re it - they\'ll just panic and freeze. Tell them to try this with closed eyes.\n\n As a variation, pair up the players and use a stopwatch. Ask the left players on the left to name as many words as possible starting with a \'t\', and ask their partners to count, for 15 or 20 seconds. Then switch.</item>
        <item name="AlphabetCircle">Great warmâ€“up game to sharpen concentration. Everyone in a circle. One player starts by throwing an A to another player. That player throws as fast as possible a B to someone else. And so on.\n\n If you work with a large group, you can divide them into 2 circles, call em Team Gold and Team Silver, and time how fast they can get to \'Z\'.\n\n As a variation. any player has the option to change the sequence from Aâ€“Z to 1â€“10 and vice versa. Time it. Or change to 1â€“10.</item>
        <item name="AlphabetGame">This is a scene consisting of 26 lines of dialog. The first line starts with a given letter (say R). The reply to that line must start with a S, and so on, until the whole alphabet has been covered. After Z comes A.\n\n Players that hesitate, or use the wrong letter Die, and are replaced by another player. The replacement needs to take over the character of the player she replaces. \n\n Urge players not to stick to the game - if you can\'t think of a good sentence to advance the story, it\'s better to just \'die\' than to screw up the story (see Chivalry).</item>
        <item name="AlphabetLetters">Players in groups of 4 or 5. When a letter is called, each group forms that letter with their bodies.</item>
        <item name="AlterEgo">An improvised scene is played, which any player can stop at any time by yelling freeze. At that point, the player steps out of the scene, and tells the audience what his character is really thinking, after which the scene continues. The other characters of course are not supposed to know what players are thinking, but the players do, and should use this.\n\n Players can use this to reveal their hidden motives. Other players can play into this, or purposely ignore this knowledge.\n\n Gimmick: characters may actually have other things on their minds than what\'s going on in the scene. E.g. a driver stopped by a cop may be thinking about the groceries his wife told him to get at the supermarket.\n\n See also Commenting . See also Scene Painting for another game that uses a similar technique.\n\n As a variation, the thoughts of the players can also be provided by players off-stage. Also known as Asides. Also known as Consciences.</item>
        <item name="AmericanIdol">This is a spoof of the format of (American) Idol, the TV show in which new singers are discovered.\n\n One player is the host, another is the bad judge, and 2 others are candidates. Both candidates introduce themselves (or are introduced by the host) and then sing their song based on an audience suggestion. Afterwards the judge tears them apart.</item>
        <item name="AndThen">One player in the middle, the others sit aside. Any person can give the middle player a task, which she performs, and then she asks \'What happens next\' ? Any player may suggest what needs to happen next, but the idea is for the group to construct a coherent story.\n\n The player in the middle should only and strictly be doing what she\'s told; it is up to the players at the side to construct the story.\n\n Also known as What Happens Next.</item>
        <item name="Animalistics">Ask the audience for animals. Players play a scene, in which the characters are based on these animals.\n\n Players do not \'become\' the animals, they only take over characteristics of the animals. Characteristics may be physical, vocal or Status based. For example, \'chicken\' might ninspire a player to a cowardly character, moving about jerkily.\n\n Also known as Totems. - this can be played as an exercise: write totem names on slips of paper. Give every player a totem before they play a scene. You can extend the animal name; make it more specific. Play with things like Bald Eagle rather than Eagle; or Silver Moon, Sitting Bull, etc.</item>
        <item name="Animals">Make sure you have an even number of players. Give everyone an animal, but make sure that there are 2 of each, and that nobody knows which other player is which animal. Then give a number of activities, which the animals perform. Try\n\n Eating, Eating when you\'re really hungry, Drinking, Drinking when you\'re really thirsty, Lovemaking, Grooming, Fighting, Sleeping\n\n At the end, ask the players to find the other animal of their kind. Ask the others if they found out who was which animal.\n\n As a variation, let 2 players be humans.</item>
        <item name="ArmGame">Scene played by 4 players, playing 2 characters. Each character consists of one player, who does the voice, holding his hands behind his back. Another player stands behind player 1, and provides the hands.\n\n The story should be a give and take between voices and hands. Also known as Helping Hands. As a variation, have 2 players provide the arms, one each.</item>
        <item name="Armando">This is a long form, named after its creator, Chicago Improv teacher and player Armando Diaz. This improv format starts with a storytelling-style monologue, based on an audience suggestion. After the monologue, players play improvised scenes inspired by the monologue, and the monologue may even continue, later on in the performance.</item>
        <item name="Asides">An improvised scene is played, which any player can stop at any time by yelling freeze. At that point, the player steps out of the scene, and tells the audience what his character is really thinking, after which the scene continues. The other characters of course are not supposed to know what players are thinking, but the players do, and should use this.\n\n Players can use this to reveal their hidden motives. Other players can play into this, or purposely ignore this knowledge.\n\n Gimmick: characters may actually have other things on their minds than what\'s going on in the scene. E.g. a driver stopped by a cop may be thinking about the groceries his wife told him to get at the supermarket.\n\n See also Commenting . See also Scene Painting for another game that uses a similar technique.\n\n As a variation, the thoughts of the players can also be provided by players off-stage. Also known as Alter Ego. Also known as Consciences.</item>
        <item name="Assassin">Great warm-up for a group of 7+ people. Everyone picks someone to be their bodyguard, and somebody to be their assassin. Don\'t say out loud who picked who for what. Game starts, and everyone tries to protect themselves from their assassin, by trying to keep their bodyguard between themselves and their assassin. After several minutes of chaos everyone reveals who was picked for what.</item>
        <item name="AssociationChain">Can be done with all players at the same time, or individually. Give the player two unrelated words. They need to come up with a chain of associations that brings them from the first word to the second. You can limit the chain to e.g. 5 words (including starting and ending word.\n\n Example: Apple and Eskimo. A solution might be Apple, food, fish, icebear, Eskimo. If you do this with a group it is fun to compare \'solutions\' !</item>
        <item name="AssociationJump">This is physical association game. All plays mill about the room. At any time, trainer yells a player\'s name. That player \'jumps\' into a frozen position. Trainer can (but does not have to) sidecoach by shouting \'directions\' (see Fast Food Laban ) like \'horizontal\', \'up\', \'down\', \'sideways\', \'big\', \'small\', \'light\', \'heavy\'. The other players watch our subject jump into a position, and then build around that player, inspired by whatever the frozen position out subject jumped into. The end result is a still scene.</item>
        <item name="AtTheOscars">This is a collection of improvised scenes, all based around (the making of) a movie. We start the performance with an Oscar nomination (or win) for the Director, showing behind-the-scenes footage of her winning film. She can direct the players to re-play poorly played scene, and she can offer parts of the storyline or Tilts before they actually get played.\n\n Apart from seeing the scenes from the movie itself, we can (but don\'t have to) see scenes of what is going on behind the scenes (so you can have a totally different sub-plot going on there, if you want).\n\n Some groups also involve the guy that actually wrote the script (as in Typewriter ).\n\n Also known as Feature Film or At the Movies.</item>
        <item name="Attenborough">This improv format is like Typewriter without the typewriter: players improvise a scene, which a narrator describes and comments upon. Also known as Narrator.</item>
        <item name="AtTheMovies">This is a collection of improvised scenes, all based around (the making of) a movie. One character we definitely have in this improv format is a Director, who can direct the players to re-play poorly played scene, and who can offer parts of the storyline or Tilts before they actually get played.\n\n Apart from seeing the scenes from the movie itself, we can (but don\'t have to) see scenes of what is going on behind the scenes (so you can have a totally different sub-plot going on there, if you want).\n\n Some groups also involve the guy that actually wrote the script (as in Typewriter ).\n\n Also known as Feature Film or At the Oscars, where we start the performance with an Oscar nomination (or win) for the Director.</item>
        <item name="AudienceWarmups">Often an improv show starts with an audience warm-up. Here are some suggestions:\n \nDo a Mexican wave (audience making fluent waves with their hands above their head). \nHave he pianist/keyboard man make all kinds of sounds and have the audience imitate them \nAsk the audience to stand up and do some physical warm-up. Have them shake their arms and legs. \nHave the audience introduce themselves to strangers, tell a secret their spouse/partner doesn\'t know about to a stranger, have them hug a stranger, tell your neighbor what you ate today, your pin code \nDo an interview with the audience, where the MC is one character (say, a headmaster) and all of the audience another (say a naughty child). The audience needs to reply to the interview in one voice (all saying the same at the same time - see One Mouth ). Not an easy one, and if the audience does not feel like doing this it really sucks. When it works it\'s a real thrill. \nDivide the audience in 3 or 4 groups, and give each group a sound. Rehearse the sound with each group. Then tell a silly story, and use these sounds as sound effects. (We saw a pretty gruesome one in which one group was a car (roar), another a dog (bark) and the third group got a kind of splashing sound. The poor dog got run over by the carâ€¦ not exactly nice but the audience had fun with it) \nDo a cheering competition between the men and the women. \nRehearse different kinds of applause (from the \'polite\' applause when a scene sucks, over an \'ooh\' applause for a touching scene, to a wild roar for a hilarious scene). Have them rehearse voting for a team by cheering the team name (if that\'s your format). Rehearse a \'Die\' ( see Die ) if i you\'re going to be playing scenes in which the audience can decide to throw a player out of the game. \nGive the men and the women a different sound and play with that. Tell them they are members of a wild tribe, the women go \'Ugh\' when you raise your left hand and the man go \'Hagawaga\' when you raise your right hand.</item>
        <item name="AutomaticStorytelling">This is an exercise you can only do once with a group. Use the exercise to show that making stories is not all that difficult. Split the group in 2. Half of the players leave the room while you explain the game to the others: we are going to make stories in pairs. We will tell the other players that we came up with a great story, and they have to guess it. The catch is that they can only ask yes/no questions, and we do not really have a story. We will answer \'no\' to every question that starts with a vowel or with a conjugation of \'to be\' (or some other criterion). In addition, after having answered 2 consecutive No\'s we will always answer a yes.\n\n Let the other players back in and pair them up with the others. Each couple starts guessing the story, unknowingly creating a story as they go. Continue till they get it.\n\n This exercise is described by Keith Johnstone in Impro for Storytellers.</item>
        <item name="BackDancing">Played in pairs. Actors stand back to back, and dance on different kinds of music. Back must stay in touch at all times.</item>
        <item name="BackToBack">This is can be used as a Trust exercise, as well as in performance. 2 players perform a slow dance together; each with their head on the other\'s shoulder. Hence they are not looking at each other. While dancing they perform a 2â€“3 minute scene.\n\n This gives for great listening practice, since players aren\'t looking at their partners. If is also good for overcoming (physical) awkwardness between partners that are not familiar. And it is a great exercise for physical work in the dance, as in physical expression of the character\'s feelings.\n\n As a variation, drop the dance, and have players do a scene sitting back-to-back. In the scene the characters need not be static; they may be walking, running, performinc any activity; it\'s just the players who are sitting down. Also known as Janus Dance.</item>
        <item name="BackwardsInterview">To play this improv game, ask for a topic for a TV interview. Then 2 players do the interview backwards. That means that the first sentence uttered is the last one in the interview, perhaps something like: Thanks for that enlightening explanation. (to the guest) To all of you viewers at home, thank you for watching, and see you next week. And then players work their way backwards.\n\n Various gimmicks can be played. For example, in your responses, you can pimp players. Examples would be: Thank you for that very energetic answer to the question, pimping the other player to do something very energetic.\n\n As a variation, the \'backwards\' gimmick can be used to play any improvised scene - Also known as Backwards Scene. In that way, don\'t base your play on verbal wit only; use gestures and Object Work as well.</item>
        <item name="BackwardsScene">To play this improv game, ask for a topic for a scene. Then 2 players do the scene backwards.

Examples would be: Thank you for that very energetic answer to the question, pimping the other player to do something very energetic.\n\n As a variation, the \'backwards\' gimmick can be used to play any improvised scene - Also known as Backwards Interview. In that way, base your play on verbal wit only.</item>
        <item name="Balladeer1">In this musical improv handle, one player is the balladeer, who starts singing a ballad about an audience suggestion. The other players actually play what the balladeer sings about, in slow motion. This is actually group story-building, as the players are inspired by the what the balladeer sings (obviously) but also, their actions can/should inspire the balladeer.\n\n You\'re not limited to ballads, of course. The same improv Handle can be used for a Long Form structure: see Balladeer(2).\n\n The Improvoholics developed this game.</item>
        <item name="Balladeer2">This is like the short form version Balladeer(1), but in this long form improv format, as soon as the balladeer stops singing or finishes the song, the characters start playing and talking independently. When their scene is done the balladeer starts a new song, and so forth.</item>
        <item name="BandaidTag">One person is it. Whenever someone is tagged by it they must hold a bandaid (their hand) on the spot where they were tagged. Then the game continues. When someone runs out of bandaids, (they get tagged three times), they are frozen until two other people come over to them and operate. The two other people need to tag the frozen person at the same time and count to five.</item>
        <item name="BarPro">The (slightly negative sounding) name is attributed to Keith Johnstone and refers to shows consisting of short games, played in small rooms, like bars and tiny comedy clubs.\n\n In this simple format, a limited number of players (4â€“6) play improv games, introduced, and usually directed by an MC. In certain troupes the players take turns MC-ing and/or directing.\n\n There are usually no judges, no score boards and no prizes to be won. Suggestions are taken from the audience, drawn out of a hat or provided by the MC. Due to the lack of space, there are usually no props or attributes, except for perhaps a coat hanger with clothes and a couple of hats; players typically mime their props.\n\n As far as we know the name BarPro is not copyrighted.</item>
        <item name="Barney">Silly warm-up game. Everyone in a circle, one person as a \'caller\' in the middle. Caller yells a letter to one of the players; that player must come up with a name of a person, an object or a service that can be sold, and a location, all starting with the letter given. Example would be \'B\' which leads to Barney sells Bread in Bulgaria. Anything goes, as long as it comes out right away; if not the player becomes caller.</item>
        <item name="Barnyard">Each person is given the name of an animal with approximately three-five people having the same animal. Spread the group across the room. No one is allowed to tell which animal he is. At the signal each person makes the noise of the animal that he has been given. The first group to find all of their animals and sit down are the winners.</item>
        <item name="Bartender">A silly Short Form handle: ask for a silly problem. Player 1 goes into a bar and explains his woes to the bartender in an improvised song. The bartender then fixes the problem in another improvised song.\n\n See also Three Melodies .</item>
        <item name="BearOfPointers">One player is \'it\' and stands at one end of the room, facing the wall. The other players at the other end of the room. Players need to try and get to the player who is \'it\' without \'it\' seeing them move. The player who is \'it\' can turn around at any time - at that point everybody else needs to freeze. Anyone who is caught moving is out.\n\n Also known as Catch\'em.</item>
        <item name="BeastyRap">Everyone get in a circle and get a beat running; use a beatbox, cd or mp3. First player starts rapping a line, any line, on the beat. Without skipping too many beats, next player adds a line that rhymes and so on until a player fails to come up with a line, misses the beat or fails to rhyme, after which everybody goes \'Dang\', and the next player starts a next round. When the players not rapping feel the rhyme word of the active player coming, they all join in and yell the word together at the end of every line.\n\n For (not improvised) inspiration check out \'Intergalactic\' by the Beastie Boys.</item>
        <item name="BeatnikPoet">Tell the audience we are going to improvise a bad poetry night at pseudo- intellectual coffee house. Ask for 2 unrelated objects or concepts. All players perform a poem that has both suggestions. If they miss out a suggestion or if they don\'t rhyme, the audience yells Die! and the player commits suicide on stage.</item>
        <item name="Become">This one can be player with all players at a time, or you can ask the group to watch as players come up with different ideas on how to do this. Ask the players to become an object.\n At first, this will probably not lead to much. Add side coachings, like:\n \nYou are a jar of mayonnaise. Opened or not? Full or empty? Fresh or not? Show it. \nYou are a flower. What kind of flower? Blooming or not? In a vase or in a field? What color? Freshly picked or not? A present to a lover or at a funeral? \nYou are water. Still or not? In a glass? A jar, a puddle, a lake or an ocean? Fresh or dirty? \nYou are stone, air, sand, fire. \nYour are blue, red, green. You are a clock. Big Ben or grandfather clock? Working or not. Is your time right or not? A watch? Who is wearing you? A nun or a pimp? How could you show that? \nYou are French fries. McDonalds or Wendy\'s? Hot or cold? Any ketchup? On a plate or in a cardboard box? Eaten or not? Yummy or yuck?\n\n After a while, players should be able to come up with the side coachings for themselves. Encourage the players to try out different kind of stuff, see what they come up with.</item>
        <item name="BeforeOrAfter">A short scene is improvised. After that the host asks the audience whether they want to see what happened before this scene, or what happens after this scene. This is a variation on the Fast Forward improv game.</item>
        <item name="BermudaTriangle">Start a scene, and identify each of the characters by means of a hat. The MC will interrupt (freeze) the game from time to time, and switch the players\' hats. After the switch each player becomes the character that previously wore his or her hat. The story needs to continue and should make sense.\n\n A gimmick is Commenting on the fact that characters \'jump\' in space when the hats gets switched. Use sparingly. Also known as Hat Continuation.</item>
        <item name="BidirectionalSatelliteTV">Fairly difficult combination of the Satellite TV and Satellite Radio improv games: players in pairs, establish a beat. Every beat, player 1 offers a movement and player 2 offers a word of a story. At the same time, players mirror each other, with a delay of 1 beat.</item>
        <item name="BigBlob">Players perform a scene in a location that contains an enormous blob of blubber. Something yukkie. Players must walk or move through this blob as the scene continues, but their characters are not supposed to acknowledge that this Big Blob is there.</item>
        <item name="BigBooty">Everyone in a circle. One player is Big Booty. The others, going clockwise, are numbered: 1, 2, 3 and so on. Now Big Booty establishes a 4-beat rhythm, saying Big Booty, Big Booty, Big Booty (followed by a rest) - repeat this until everyone got the rhythm. The game then goes as follows: Big Booty passes the buck to someone else, saying Big Booty to 7 (say) (this takes 2 beats, one for saying \'Big Booty\' and one for saying \'to 7\'). Number 7 then passes in 2 beats to, say number 2, saying \'7 to 2\'. It then continues until someone makes a mistake: if and when that happens everyone says (in 2 beats) \'Oh Shit\', after which we repeat Big Booty Big Booty Big Booty ( + rest on 4th beat), twice. After that, the player that made the mistake becomes Big Booty, and everyone\'s number changes. New Big Booty starts the game again.</item>
        <item name="BigFishSmallFish">Fun energizer game. Everyone in a circle. We are going to pass a pattern along the circle. Everyone, at their turn does either:\n Say Big Fish, and hold both hands in front of you, about 3 inches or 10cm apart. It then passes to the next person in the circle.\n Say Small Fish, and hold both hands in front of you, about 15 inches or 50cm apart. When this is done, the direction changes.\n Players that miss (e.g. say Small Fish and keep your hands too close together or say Big Fish and move hands wide) do a forfeit, or die with a loud noise.</item>
        <item name="BippetyBop1">Silly warm-up to get the blood flowing. A players in a circle, one player in the middle. The player in the middle closes his eyes, holds right hand pointing in front of him, and spins around. When done spinning, open your eyes and say, as fast as you can \'Bippety Bippety Bop\'. The player you\'re pointing to, and his 2 neighbors, need to build an elephant in less than the time the middle player needs to say \'Bippety Bippety Bop\'. An elephant consists of a trunk, made by the middle player, by holding your nose with one hand, and extending your other arm through the arm that holds the hand that holds the nose (does this make any sense?). The neighboring players each form a big ear, using both arms. Don\'t forget to attach the ears to the elephant\'s head.\n\n Any player that cannot get his/her part done by the time the middle player does \'Bippety Bippety Bop\' becomes \'it\' and takes place in the middle of the circle.\n\n As a variation, you can really invent any object or create to replace the elephant. Try:\n \na car, with 2 wheels and a set of wind screen wipers \na cow, with an udder and 2 horns \na washing machine, with 2 players building a \'box\' with both arms, and the middle player waving her arms in a circle in front of her. All go \'rumble rumble\' \na bunny, with 2 paws (middle player) and 2 rabbit ears (neighbors)\n\n Also known as Also known as Bappety Boo. See also Bunny . See Elephant for a more elaborate version of the game. See Bippety Bop(2) for a variation that goes by the same name.</item>
        <item name="BippetyBop2">This is a variation on Bippety Bop(1): all players in a circle, one player in the middle who is \'it\'. This player picks a player in the circle and yells \'bippety-bippety-bop\' at her. If he manages to get to \'bop\' before she can say \'bop\', she becomes \'it\'. Other possibilities are:\n \nJust say \'bop\' if anyone else reacts, that person becomes \'it\' \nSay \'Elephant\', after which 3 players build the elephant: the player picked does the trunk (hold nose and squeeze your other arm through) and her neighbors do the ears. If any of the 3 players screws up or does not react he or she becomes it. \nSay \'mixer\': the player in the middle becomes a mixer, holding arms up in the air, sort of horizontally, while her neighbors position themselves under her hands, and turn around their axises \nSay \'toaster\' : the player in the middle becomes a slice of bread, and her neighbors become the toaster, by \'building\' the toaster with their arms around the bread. The slice of bread pops up an down too when done! \nFeel free to invent other objects (suggestions can be found under Bippety Bop(1)).</item>
        <item name="BlackBox">This improv game is played by 2 players. One holds a (mimed) black box, which has 3 buttons, one of which is red. These buttons control a player; one button might be the \'jerk your leg\' button. The exact functions of each button are not defined. The other player enters and asks if he can play with the box. Player 1 agrees, but adds something like Whatever you do, don\'t push the red button.\n\n Player 2 begins to play with the buttons, controlling player 2. Then, we slowly work up to the use of the dreaded red button, which will make player 2 do something not-so-obvious. This can be anything, but it should not be preconceived. The red button might become a Mood swing button, a Start Screaming, Start Giggling, Sing Opera, or Switch-to- Gibberish button.</item>
        <item name="BlindAssociationCircle">This one starts just like Free Association Circle : players in a circle, establish a rhythm, and freely associate on previous player\'s word. As this is going on, the trainer will tap all players gently on the shoulder, at 3 times:\n First tap: players close their eyes but continue the free association, sticking to the rhythm\n Second tap: everyone starts walking around (carefully!), eyes still closed.Players have to recognize the voice of their ex-neighbour in the circle to know when it\'s their turn.\n Third tap: all players, still eyes closed, and still associating, try to reconstruct the circle.\n Exercise is over when everyone is in a circle again. Trainer should keep an eye on players to make sure they don\'t run into things. It helps if there\'s not too much clutter around, of course.</item>
        <item name="BlindFreeze">This one is just like Freeze Tag, but here the MC calls Freeze, and calls in another player. If you\'re not using an MC, any player might call Freeze and call in any other player.\n\n Many groups find this game more exciting than Freeze Tag, as players don\'t know when they get pushed in the game, and hence are less prepared, and crazier, more exciting stuff tends to happen.</item>
        <item name="BlindHarold">This is really a listening exercise, though it has been performed as a Long Form for audiences. Basically, this is a Harold, played with all players sitting down with their eyes closed. For a performance one would turn all the lights off in the theater.\n\n See also The Bat .</item>
        <item name="BlindHunt">A number of players stand in the middle of the room, eyes closed the others stand by the walls. One of the middle players is tapped on the shoulder, she become the \'killer\' or the \'vampire\'. The trainer give a go-sign, and all \'blinded\' players start milling around the room. When the killer bumps into someone, she squeezes that persons forearm to \'kill\' him. When a victim dies, he utters a scream, opens his eyes and is \'out\'. Game is over when all potential victims are dead.\n\n Audience by the walls make sure that blind players don\'t bump into stuff or hurt themselves.\n\n As a variation, when a \'vampire\' runs into a victim, the victim becomes a vampire too.\n Or, when 2 vampires bump into one anther, they become normal mortal souls again.\n Also known as Scorpion. Also known as Screamers. Also known as Haunted House. Also known as Blind Stalker. Also known as Vampire Game. See also Death and Retriever</item>
        <item name="BlindLead">One player is blindfolded, and the room is filled with obstacles (put a couple of chairs everywhere, leave all kinds of junk on the floor). The idea is that the rest of the group will lead the blindfolded player through the room, by talking.\n\n Also known as Airplane. Also known as Obstacle Course. Also known as Mine Field. See also Fingertips for a similar exercise.</item>
        <item name="BlindLineOffers">Line up the players, give\'em each a number. Call out 2 numbers. Those players step on stage immediately, with a physical Offer (do something, eat an apple, wipe the floor, whatever) as well as a vocal offer (say something).\n\n The idea is that the players accept and explore each other\'s offers and figure out what the scene is about.</item>
        <item name="BlindLineUp">This one is like Group Order, except that everyone keeps their eyes closed, and no talking is allowed while the group lines up.\n\n This is more a group exercise than Group Order (which is more about agreement), so initially you probably want to take it easy on the silly stuff, like line up by order of mental healthâ€¦ You can\'t really use alphabetical order if the group does not really know each other.</item>
        <item name="BlindMusical">This is like a musical version of Pockets : ask the audience to write simple sentences on slips of paper. Hand each player 2 or 3 slips (they\'re not allowed to read them yet). Play a scene or series of improvised scenes. Players draw slips of paper at random, and every time they do, they start a song that starts with the sentence on the slip. Try to integrate the info on the slips into the story, of course!\n\n As a variation, leave strips of paper on the ground for players to pick up.</item>
        <item name="BlindStalker">A number of players stand in the middle of the room, eyes closed the others stand by the walls. One of the middle players is tapped on the shoulder, she become the \'killer\' or the \'vampire\'. The trainer give a go-sign, and all \'blinded\' players start milling around the room. When the killer bumps into someone, she squeezes that persons forearm to \'kill\' him. When a victim dies, he utters a scream, opens his eyes and is \'out\'. Game is over when all potential victims are dead.\n\n Audience by the walls make sure that blind players don\'t bump into stuff or hurt themselves.\n\n As a variation, when a \'vampire\' runs into a victim, the victim becomes a vampire too.\n Or, when 2 vampires bump into one anther, they become normal mortal souls again.\n Also known as Scorpion. Also known as Screamers. Also known as Haunted House. Also known as Blind Hunt. Also known as Vampire Game. See also Death and Retriever</item>
        <item name="BlindfoldedScene">Players are blindfolded and then play a scene.</item>
        <item name="BluesJam">Ask the audience for 5 things that give them the blues. Then improvise a blues jam about those elements.</item>
        <item name="BobsleddingBodies">This is a physical team game. Form teams of 4 â€“ 6 players. Teams sit in a line and wrap their legs around the person in front of them. Place masking tape about 10 â€“ 15 feet away to mark the end line. On GO, teams must only use their hands to slide their way to the end. If a team breaks apart, they must get back together before they continue.</item>
        <item name="BodyHide">Excellent exercise to get to know each other, and to learn to trust and touch each other. 5 volunteers. 4 of these must try and hide the fifth person, using nothing but their bodies. The other students stand around the group and try and see pieces of the fifth\'s clothes, shoes, skin.\n\n It\'s great fun for the other students to watch and try and find uncovered pieces of person. Don\'t tell them they go next, with one person less.\n\n As a variation, try this game with less and less \'hiders\'. If the task becomes impossible, tell them they can use parts of walls. Using a corner is easiest, of course, but let them figure that out themselves.</item>
        <item name="BongBongBong">Silly game, inspired by a Korean TV show.\n\n 4 players, 3 stand with their ears closed, backs turned to the scene. The 4th player gets as a suggestion a common expression.\n\n The idea is that this player has 1 minute to communicate this suggestion to the 2nd player, using only mime and Gibberish . Number 2 then communicates (what he has understood) to number 3, who does the same to number 4. At the end yell Bong Bong Bong and have players 2, 3 and 4 explain what they thought they understood.\n\n A similar technique is used in LCD .</item>
        <item name="BoomChicago">One player starts the exercise by miming his location (interacting with objects, furnitureâ€¦). As soon as it\'s clear where this person is, a second player comes on. This person establishes the relationship between them in a single sentence ( \'Mother, I\'m sorry I\'m a little late.\'). The first person then presents a problem, preferably through miming or in a single sentence. A third player then enters the scene to fix the problem through miming or in a single sentence. As soon as the problem is fixed, all three players shout \'TADAAA!\' accompanied by an appropriate gesture (show hands).\n\n This is a good exercise to remind players to establish relationships early on, create problems which are relevant to the given setting and to resolve them without delays.</item>
        <item name="Boris">2 players play an improvised interrogation scene. One is the interrogator, the other is a suspect. The interrogator randomly throws unconnected elements to the suspect, who needs to incorporate these and get himself into (even more) trouble. And then we have Boris, who is a nasty, huge, but invisible thug assisting the interrogator. Every time the interrogator does not like the suspect\'s answers (and also when the suspect does not incriminate himself enough), the interrogator calls on Boris to torture the suspect, prodding him to confess or incriminate him even further.\n\n Note that we do not establish the crime beforehand, the suspect mimes being tortured by Boris, and that the investigator can tell Boris what to do (break his leg), but it is more fun to leave the choice of torture up to the suspect. If the torture does not go far enough to the investigator\'s taste, he can always call in Boris\' evil twin brother, Igor (also invisible). As a gag, the suspect can also incriminate Boris (who can turn out to be a witness/accomplice to the crime).\n\n This improv game is attributed to Keith Johnstone.</item>
        <item name="Bucket">Before the show ask the audience to write simple sentences on slips of paper. Those go in a big bucket. A scene is improvised, and at random moments the players don\'t just invent a line of dialog, but use a line off a piece of paper drawn from the bucket. Anything said is accepted, heightened and integrated.</item>
        <item name="BucketOfDeath">We need three or four players for this improv game. During an improvised scene, one player is always off-stage, with his head inside a dry cleaning bag, slowly suffocating. He is not allowed out of the bag until some other player finds a way to exit the scene and \'liberate\' the suffocating player. New player puts his head into the bag until freed by another player, and first liberated player finds a way to justify his entrance into the scene.\n\n As a variation, use a bucket of water instead of a dry cleaning bag. Also known as Dry Cleaning Bag of Death. Also known as Head in Bucket. .</item>
        <item name="BumpityBump">Fun game for a new group to get to know each other. All players in a circle. Give them time to ask the names of the players on either side of them. Once the names are known, the person in the middle goes up to a player and says (name), bumpity, bump, bump, bump. That person then has to say the names of the people sitting/standing beside him/her before the middle person finishes saying bumpity, bump, bump, bump.\n\n As a variation, the person in the middle can randomly yell out bumpity, bump, bump, bump, and everyone has to find a new spot on the edge of the circle.</item>
        <item name="Bunny">Extremely silly game, to pump up the energy. Get everyone in a circle. One player becomes the body of a bunny - this is done by holding both arms in front of your chest, elbows touching your rib cage, and letting hands hang. Her 2 neighbors become the \'ears\' of the bunny, by waving a hand next to the middle player\'s ears. All 3 say \'bunny, bunny, bunny\' together, until the middle player \'throws\' a \'bunny\' to another player in the circle. This player becomes the bunny body, and his neighbors get to do the ears.\n\n Play this game at a high speed. Mumbling \'bunny bunny\' en masse gives a nice energy boost.\n\n As a variation, play in slow motion. Hilarious! Alternatively, you can really invent any object or create or replace the bunny, as long as you invent a sound along with it. Try\n \na car, with 2 wheels and a set of wind screen wipers, going \'vroom vroom\' \na cow, with an udder and 2 horns, going \'moo moo\' \na washing machine, with 2 players building a \'box\' with both arms, and the middle player waving her arms in a circle in front of her. All go \'rumble rumble\' \nan elephant, with 2 big ears and a trunk, making an elephant sound (if you don\'t know what an elephant sounds like, just invent a sound).\n\n See also Bippety Bop(1). See also Killer Bunny.</item>
        <item name="CDShop">This is a variation on Greatest Hits, for those over 30 (those under 30 never bought CDs in a physical shop, we fear). Setting is a CD shop, one player is the sales person, the other is a client. Audience suggestion is someone to buy a present for, or an occasion to buy a present. Say graduating medical school. The buyer is looking for an appropriate CD to buy for this person/occasion.\n\n The seller presents several CDs, each CD gets an explicit style/artist, and the seller offers to demo an appropriate song. E.g. for the graduation, How about a Lady Gaga album? Her new album is called Doctor Love and it has this great song Measles. One or more other players (and preferably a musician) then perform the song.\n\n\nAfter 3â€“4 songs the buyer agrees to buy the album and scene ends.</item>
        <item name="CallFromRay">A scene is begun. At some point in the scene an onstage player has to receive a Call from Ray (or any other name agreed upon). The call can come in any form, like phone call, SMS, smoke signals, telepathy or whatever, and Ray himself may not appear in the scene.\n\n As a variation, you can come up with any sentence that needs to come up. A variation would be to use I\'ll have a coke - Also known as I\'ll have a coke.</item>
        <item name="CardStatus">4 players. Ask an audience member to pick 4 cards out of a deck, and attach a card to each player\'s forehead, so that players can see each other\'s card, but not their own. Use a rubber band or a piece of string for that.\n\n The idea is to improvize a scene, in which the status order of the characters is defined by the cards. Evidently, players don\'t know their own status, so the other players will have to endow them.\n\n Set up a location where status is important. Examples would be a Royal Palace or a highly organized bureaucracy (the White House ?).\n\n There are many variations. Players can only see their own card, but not the others\'. Give players multiple cards, and let them switch cards in the middle of the scene. Statuses should change accordingly. As an exercise, let players play a scene and then ask them to line up in status order to see if they \'got\' their status right.</item>
        <item name="Cards">Ask the audience to write short sentences on cards. Give 2 players 3 cards, which they put in their pockets. Then they play a scene. At any point in time, instead of saying whatever they think they might say, they take a card, and read what\'s on the card. Whatever is said should be justified.\n\n See also Actor\'s Nightmare .</item>
        <item name="CatAndMouse">All players in pairs. One player is cat, one other player is mouse, and all others stay in pairs, arms hooked together. Cat chases mouse; when mouse is caught then mouse becomes cat and vice versa. However, mouse can escape chase by hooking into any pair of other players. At that point the player at the other end of the pair becomes cat and the cat becomes mouse.</item>
        <item name="CatchEm">One player is \'it\' and stands at one end of the room, facing the wall. The other players at the other end of the room. Players need to try and get to the player who is \'it\' without \'it\' seeing them move. The player who is \'it\' can turn around at any time - at that point everybody else needs to freeze. Anyone who is caught moving is out.\n\n Also known as Bear of Poitiers.</item>
        <item name="ChainMurder">One player on stage, the others off stage. The audience provides a location, an occupation and an object, only known to the player on stage. Second player enters and a scene is played in gibberish. Player one needs to communicate the location to player 2; as soon as player 2 thinks he\'s got it, her claps his hands and spins around. Then player 2 needs to guess the occupation; clap and spin when you think you got it. Finally, the object needs to be revealed. As soon as player 2 has the object, he needs to kill player 1 with it.\n\n Then the next player comes on stage and the game recommences, until all players have played. Afterwards, line up the players and ask them where they think they were, what their occupation was and what the murder weapon was - usually quite far off the original suggestion, much to the audience\'s amusement.\n\n Also known as LOW. (Location, Occupation, Weapon) or LCD (Location, Career, Death). See also Hijacker for a similar game without the Gibberish component.\n\n As a variation, use a bell, every 10 seconds or so; at the bell players need to clap and spin and proceed to the next step, even if they are not sure about the where, who and what. Or, have the first two players go for 60 seconds, then the next player for 30 seconds, then 15, then 7.5, etc.</item>
        <item name="CharacterSwap">2 players improvise a scene, and make distinct strong physical and vocal choices. Scene is played until we know the characters. Then the roles are reversed, and every player plays the other\'s character, in the same scene, same location.\n\n The exercise trains listening and physical observation, and is a great way to get players to break away from their stock characters.</item>
        <item name="CharacterWalk">Great exercise to develop characters. Players mill about the room as themselves. Ask the players to find some sort of inspiration, and then they should use that to change their walk. Anything can be used as inspiration: use an emotion (happy!), an occupation (farmer!), a stereotype (Irish!), an animal (Snake!) or even an object (grandfather clock!).\n\n Next, turn the way you are walking into a character. Explore how the character walks and - by Association - figure out as much as possible about this character.\n\n As a variation, if you use a way of movement as inspiration you end up with something like Fast Food Laban .</item>
        <item name="ChivalrousCouples">One person with a loud voice will stand on a chair or other high place so that they can be seen above the heads of the group. After you have explained the game and everyone is ready the person on the chair will call out one of the following couples: Knight and Queen, Prince and Princess, and Horse and Rider. When one of these three couples is called people must get into pairs. If Horse and Rider were called one of the people in the pairs will be the Horse and one will be the Rider. Then the pairs will get into the correct formation.\n\n Each of the three chivalrous couples has its own formation that goes with it. The Knight and Queen\'s formation is one person as the Knight down on one knee and the other person as the Queen sitting on the Knight\'s knee. The Prince and Princess formation is one person as the Prince will have the other person, the Princess, in their arms. The Horse and Rider formation is the Horse will be standing up and the Rider will be riding piggy-back on the Horse.\n\n The last pair to get into the correct formation is either out of the game or they Take 5 off to the side of the group. After one chivalrous couple has been called and one or two pairs of people have been eliminated have the group mingle. Then randomly call another couple. Have the group try to get into pairs with different people at every round.</item>
        <item name="CircleSitting">Have everyone stand in a circle, really close to each other, facing inwards. Then ask everyone to make a quarter turn left. Make everyone stand even closer to each other. When ask the whole group to sit down. If everyone is really close, they will end up sitting on one another\'s knees, and the whole construction supports itself. If well done it\'s even possible to make the circle walk.</item>
        <item name="CircleOfKnots">Form a circle, holding hands. Then, any player can start moving about, making knots in the circle. Do this gently, and keep holding hands. Try with eyes closed or blindfolded.</item>
        <item name="ClapSnapAssociation">This one is like a Free Association Circle, except that the rhythm is more explicit. Here\'s how to do the rhythm: each beat consists of 4 phases:\n \nSlap both hands on your thighs \nClap your hands \nSnap your left hand fingers \nSnap your right hand fingers\n\n With every right hand snap, a word should be thrown to your neighbor. Once the rhythm is established, you can leave out the snaps - that\'ll make things more understandable.\n\n As a variation, you can use this for both Last Letter games or Free Association Circle. Try this with two circles. Have one circle associate freely, and another circle on Last Letter . Whenever a player misses a beat she should switch circles.</item>
        <item name="ClapSnapStamp">All players in pairs, facing each other. We\'re going to count from one to three, each player one number at a time, and we keep repeating this. So player number one would go one, three, two, one, three, and so on.\n\n Once they get this, we replace the \'one\' with a \'snap\' (snap your fingers). Once everyone is into that, we replace the \'two\' as well, with a hand-clap.\n\n Finally, we replace the \'three\' as well, with a stamp of the right foot. Play at high speed!</item>
        <item name="ClickBangYoureDead">all players sit in a circle. Only one player should know how to play and what the secret is; this player is the leader at first, until others catch on. This person points at random people in the circle each time saying either click or bang; they should make it sound and look like what they are doing has to do with math or the order they are going etc.\n\n The secret: it really doesn\'t matter who is pointed to, what is said, when they are pointed to, who it begins with or who it ends with, it just depends on who speaks first after the clicks and bangs are done. So the person who begins (the one that knows what\'s going on) will declare whoever talks first dead by saying you\'re dead. That person isn\'t out or anything, it\'s just for effect. The game continues until the players catch on. If somebody thinks they get it, the leader gives them a chance to say the clicks and bangs and they get to announce who is dead; the leader will then be able to tell if they understand the secret if they announce the right person as being dead.\n\n Make sure that once the players begin to catch on, they don\'t spoil it for the others by letting the cat out of the bag. Also, the game is best if played with ten or more people.\n\n Contributed by Jeannie Smith from Hawai.</item>
        <item name="CloudAtlas">Cloud Atlas is a book by author David Mitchell, which has a peculiar structure. The same structure can be used to create a Long Form improv show. For details on the book (spoiler alert) see.\n\n Here is how the format works: it is a long form show with an intermission. Before the break, a number of stories (6 stories in the original book, but any number above 2 will work) are half told; these stories take place in history, time running forward, and each story is played in a particular, different style. After the break, the stories are finished, one after the other, but in inverse order. By the end of the show, the stories should have connections between them.\n\n An example to clarify. Ask 4 suggestions of historical periods and locations, in historical order. The (near and far) future are allowed. Suppose we get: french revolution, first world war Britain, today (2013-ish) USA and 2030 China. This will lead to 4 story lines, and 8 parts, 4 before the break and 4 after. Each story line is played as a Straight Story . For example:\n \nStory 1/part 1: Dramatic story in france during revolution \nStory 2/part 1: Love story during WW1 \nStory 3/part 1: Thriller in USA, current time \nStory 4/part 1: Musical in post-communist China \nBreak \nSecond half of story 4 \nSecond part of story 3 \nSecond half of story 2 \nSecond part of story 1\n\n There should be a link from story 1 to story 2, one from story 2 to story 3 and one from story 3 to story 4. All the links should be different in kind and not be purely thematic, e.g. a book written by a character in story 1 may be important in story 2; an invention done in story 2 may be linked to a character\'s profession in story 3 and so forth. If one link is a character the other links should not be characters. Ideally, not all links are established before the break. For a really concrete example see the wikipedia link on the plots in Mitchell\'s book.\n\n Original book by David Mitchell, 2004. Idea of using the structure for a long form is attributed to Tom Tollenaere.</item>
        <item name="ColombianHypnosis">Played in pairs. One player holds her open hand, fingers upward, about 2â€“3 inches from her partner\'s face. She then starts moving her hand about slowly, while her partner tried to keep his face at exactly the same distance from her hand, like her hand is pulling of pushing his face about.\n\n Switch sides and partners after a couple of minutes.Described in Augusto Boal \'s Games for Actors and Non-actors.</item>
        <item name="ComedySportz">ComedySports was started by Dick Chudnow in 1984 in Milwaukee. It\'s a format of competitive improv comedy that resembles Keith Johnstone\'s Theatresports . The format is currently played by a dozen-plus teams all over the USA, united in the Comedy League of America.\n\n In a ComedySportz show 2 teams complete for points given by the audience. A referee oversees the match, times the games, calls fouls and gets audience suggestions. A match consists of something like 7 to 12 games, drawn from a repertoire of over a hundred improv games (you\'ll find most of these games in the Games section of Improv Encyclopedia, at the link at the top of this list).\n\n In terms of gimmicks, you have the \'brown bag foul\', which is a brown paper bag placed over the offending player\'s head.</item>
        <item name="ComingHome">Ask players to think of someone they know. Then ask them to play how that person would come home from work. Players need to pay attention to the environment: what does that person\'s house look like? Is it neat and tidy or is it a mess? Big house or small apartment?\n \nWhat does he do? Does the character change clothes or showers or has a beer first? Does he eat? If so, what? Microwave dinner, carryout, pizza delivery or cornflakes? \nWhat mood is that character in? \nHow was work today?\n\n As a variation, have the players come up with other locations they could be entering.</item>
        <item name="Commercial">Ask for a product (existing or non-existing). Then play a commercial for that product.\n\n As a variation, you can do this as a radio commercial. Cut the lights in the theater. ( see Scene in the Dark). Or, you can play the whole development of the commercial, starting with the brainstorming by the marketing guys, the work of the production company coming up with a slogan, jingle, etc. You can even play the bloopers at the actual taping of the commercial.</item>
        <item name="CommunalMonologue">All improvisers in a circle. One player in the middle, and that player starts improvising a monologue. At any point in time, any other player may step (or rather glide) in and take the middle\'s player\'s place, and continue the monologue. The transitions should be smooth of course.</item>
        <item name="CompleteBodies">Players in pairs. One player takes a position, using all parts of her body. The other player completes that position, by folding over/in/around the first player, without touching her. First player then completes second player in another pose, again without touching.\n\n As a next step, do the same, but tell a story, one sentence at a time, providing a sentence every time you move.</item>
        <item name="ConcentrationCircle">Place all players in a circle and number them sequentially, starting with a random player. The players then establish a rhythm, for example by swinging their left hands up and down. Have player 1 start; when her arm is up she shouts/throws a number. The player with that number needs to throw another nnumber at the next beat.\n\n Players that fail (if they did not recognize their own number) or that break the rhythm become the last player in the circle, and that changes the numbers for a bunch of players. Restart with player one. See also Big Booty .</item>
        <item name="ConductedStory">Players form a line on the stage. A title for a story, and a story genre is obtained from the audience. The MC starts the game by pointing to a player, who needs to start telling the story. At any point in time the MC can switch to another player, who needs to continue the story flawlessly, even if the switch happened in the middle of a sentence or even in the middle of a word.\n\n Players that hesitate, or whose sentences are not grammatically correct or don\'t make sense, are boo-ed out of the game, by the audience yelling \'Die\'. The last player left nends the story. Also known as Story Story Die.</item>
        <item name="Confessions">Not exactly theater but fun when played well. The MC gets a bunch of \'confessions\' from the audience. These can be really lame, like e.g. \'I vote democratic\', \'I used to be a man\', \'I sold a kidney\', whatever.\n\n Then players line up. One player steps forward, and gets a confession from the host. Player utters the confession in a character, and immediately another player jumps in and offers a witty reply. Do this as long as players have ideas for replies. Then replace the first player by a new one, give her a new confession and repeat ad libitum.</item>
        <item name="Consciences">An improvised scene is played, which any player can stop at any time by yelling freeze. At that point, the player steps out of the scene, and tells the audience what his character is really thinking, after which the scene continues. The other characters of course are not supposed to know what players are thinking, but the players do, and should use this.\n\n Players can use this to reveal their hidden motives. Other players can play into this, or purposely ignore this knowledge.\n\n Gimmick: characters may actually have other things on their minds than what\'s going on in the scene. E.g. a driver stopped by a cop may be thinking about the groceries his wife told him to get at the supermarket.\n\n See also Commenting. See also Scene Painting for another game that uses a similar technique.\n\n As a variation, the thoughts of the players can also be provided by players off-stage. Also known as Alter Ego. Also known as Asides.</item>
        <item name="ContinuingEmotions">A \'neutral\' improvised scene is started, and is then interrupted (frozen) several times by the MC. The scene is then continued but all characters switch to an emotion provided by the audience.</item>
        <item name="ContinuingStyles">A \'neutral\' improvised scene is started. This scene gets interrupted several times by the MC, and then continued in a film/ literature/ drama/ TV-program style provided by the audience. The platform and the story need to continue flawlessly.</item>
        <item name="CopyCat">CopyCat goes like a verbal Freeze Tag . A scene is started. At any time, a player at the side can step forward (the playing players hold off for a moment) and repeats a line that was said in the scene. Whoever originally said that line, steps aside, and the remaining players start a new scene starting with the line that was repeated.\n\n As a variation, feel free to actually continue the ongoing scene rather than to start a completely new one. Feel free to replace all the players instead of just the player who said the last line. Rather than just stepping in and repeating a line, you might want to call \'FLIP\' (or freeze). This variation is also known as FLIP.</item>
        <item name="Countdown">Ask 2 players to play a short scene. The scene is timed to 60 seconds. Then ask the players to replay the scene in 30 seconds, then in 15 seconds and so on. This is also known as Half-Life.\n\n As a variation, you can limit the number of lines each player says and reduce that with each replay.\n\n Alternatively, have the scene replayed by 2 other players or insist that the dialog remains exactly the same.\n\n</item>
        <item name="CrabtreesConundrum">This game is taking from Mrs. Crabtree from South Park. 2 players start a scene and every now and then a player will say What\'d you say? And the other player must come up with a completely different phrase that rhymes with the one just said.\n\n For instance. Christine, I think you are as sick as a dog!! What\'d you say? I said I think we should go for a jog, it\'s a really nice day.. and so forth. See Ding for a similar game.</item>
        <item name="CreateObstacles">Two players chase each other about the room. The player that is being chased mimes obstacles for the other, who then has to overcome these obstacles.</item>
        <item name="CrimeEndowments">One player is endowed as the head of a criminal organization and gathers with the others to plan or act out the crime. He is endowed with â€œsomething to steal, hijack or kill, â€œa method or weapon, and some wild card such as a code word or in a disguise.\n\n This is sort of a generalisation of Hijacker .</item>
        <item name="CrisisSituation">Great exercise for spontaneity. 2 players on stage approach each other with a crisis, and an object unrelated to the crisis. After each has presented his or hers, each solves the other\'s crisis with their own object. Replies must be instantaneous and may be ridiculous.\n\n Example: \nPlayer A: My wife left me and I\'m stuck here with this t-shirt \nPlayer B: I got robbed and all I have left is my good looks. \nPlayer A: Here\'s my t-shirt; you can sell it and make some money. \nPlayer B: Ermâ€¦ Marry me.</item>
        <item name="CrossCircle">Perfect game to learn each other\'s names. Everyone in a circle. One person (A) starts by calling another person\'s name (B). At that point, A starts walking towards B. Before A gets to B, B needs to call another name Â©, so B frees her spot in the circle, for A to take. C then needs to call yet another name and start walking, so B can take C\'s spot.\n\n As a variation, instead of calling names, players can pick another player by making eye contact (and nodding to acknowledge that eye contact has been made). This demands a lot of concentration. You can have more than one cycle going, if the group is big enough. Also known as Name Game. Also known as Shriner\'s Warm-up.</item>
        <item name="CrossTheCircle">Have everyone sit in a circle with one person in the center. Person in the middle names something you have, have done, or can do (e.g. â€œCross if you have ever jumped out of a plane, if you own a dog, have blue eyes). Those people that can give a positive answer to the question will cross the circle and find an open spot of someone else that answered positively. There should be one person left in the center. This person then gets to pick the topic.</item>
        <item name="Cut">This Long Form improv game is played with 6 to 15 players. 2 players start a scene, perhaps based on an audience suggestion. In the middle of the scene, any other player can call \'Cut\', and start another scene, dragging one or more other players in the scene.\n\n All scenes are interrupted this way, and the idea is that all scenes come together in one story. Cut scenes can be continued later. Usually, every player sticks to one character. This game can be played with or without a director. Also know as Also known as Soap.\n\n As a variation, try deciding on a category before the start of this game. Possible categories are\n \nSoap series, like The Bold and the Beautiful, Dallas, Eastenders \nHospital drama, like E.R. \nCop drama, like Hill Street Blues \nRomantic Comedy, like The Love Boat \nCrime series or murder mysteries</item>
        <item name="DVDSpecialEdition">Start off with a trailer, narrated by one of the players, followed by some quick scenes, maximum 5 lines per scene. Then show the cast (every character in the movie), and follow with the whole movie. This can be done with out without director.\n\n After the movie you can do the special features. You can do deleted scenes, bloopers, you name it.\n\n A nice format for those transitioning from short form to long form, as the start of the performance is a bunch of short scenes.</item>
        <item name="DadaMonologue">Look at an object in the room and begin saying it\'s name. As you talk try not to stay on any idea for too long and make sense of nothing.\n\n Here is an example: Chairs are cheese when the trumpets tell a tale of ice cream from New York. When I was solid I wanted my own fraction in the departments store for canary birds. I can see the curtains were weaning on my father\'s tree when drops of silver teased a bed of newborn mice.</item>
        <item name="DatingGame">This is played like a Blind Date show. One player leaves the stage, and the audience provides endowments for the 3 others. Examples might be No. 1 is stupid, No. 2 is a serial killer and No. 3 thinks he\'s a macho. 4th player gets to ask 3 questions, and each of the others answers it. After the questions player 4 should guess what the endowments were.</item>
        <item name="DayInTheLife">The MC picks a member of the audience and interviews this person about their average (work) day. Questions asked may include \'What is your job?, Where do you live, with who?, What are your hobbies?, How do you get to work?, Who are your colleagues?, and more. The players then improvise a day in the life of this audience member, based on the elements provided by the interview. See also Ding Dong.\n\n\nAs a variation, instead of playing a real day, play a nightmare - Also known as Nightmare. . Host can ask what the audience member is afraid of or does not like.</item>
        <item name="DeafReplay">2 players play a scene while 2 others watch the scene, with their ears covered. When the scene is over, the 2 others re-play the scene. Obviously they\'ll do the same movements, but the dialogue will be different.</item>
        <item name="DeathCon">4 players, ask the audience who they are, what their occupation would be. These 4 characters have died together, and they are going to tell us how that came about. Players line up. The game is played in 3 rounds. In every round, each player offers some information about how they happened to die. At the end of the thirds round, they should all be dead.\n\n It\'s fun to take risks - if in the first round each of the players just offers what they happened to be doing the day they died, and where. It is quite a challenge to get these 4 stories together, including the deaths of all characters, by the end of the third round. Also known as Voices From Heaven. See also Goon River for a more open, more free Long Form version of the same Handle.</item>
        <item name="DeathAndRetriever">This one is like Scorpion, but in this version killed players are not \'out\', but can be revived. Everyone eyes closed, one player becomes the killer (tap him on the shoulder) and another one becomes the retriever. The retriever gets a towel of a scarf around her neck. Dead players scream when they are killed, keep their eyes closed and stand still. When the retriever bumps into someone that does not move (a dead body) she can revive the dead by rubbing them with the towel. When the retriever gets killed, she screams and stops moving. When another living person bumps into the retriever (recognized by the scarf), the retriever is revived, and the one that revived the retriever becomes the new retriever.\n\n Play till everyone is dead or bored.</item>
        <item name="DeathInAMinute">2 or 3 players play a 1 minute scene, in which one player must die. Tell players to take risks. Why not just drop dead after 5 seconds and leave it up to the other player to justify the death.</item>
        <item name="Deconstruction">This is a Long Form format. It starts with one rather long scene, which is followed by other, probably shorter, scenes that somehow connect to the first scene. Possible connections are characters returning or characters of situations mentioned in the first scene appear in the subsequent scenes. Subsequent scenes take place in the same environment as the first scene. The reason why the first scene should be fairly long is that it should provide enough information for other scenes to build on. The name \'Deconstruction\' can be interpreted as Take a first scene, and then deconstruct it by using characters, locations, situations, played or referred to, and play/re-use those in further scenes.\n\n Deconstruction originated at ImprovOlympic in Chicago.</item>
        <item name="Diamond">4 players in a square; 2 in front, 2 behind them. The MC or host asks for an audience suggestion for the 2 players in front. Then the host asks the players to turn the square (to the right or to the left). So now we have a different combination of players in front. These 2 get an audience suggestion. Turn again and ask for suggestion again and do this once more. Then have players take their original position.\n\n The game is played as follows: the 2 players in front start improvising a scene; the 2 players in the back move to the side to clear the stage. Players play until the host yells Call, at which time all players step back to their original positions in the square. MC then calls Right or Left, and square turns accordingly. The 2 players in front start playing a scene based on their suggestion until MC calls again.\n\n This is repeated. When 2 players are up front for the second or third time, they continue their previously played scene. They can either plainly continue it, or continue at some time in the future (a day later, a year later, a century later). Also known as Revolver. Also known as Pan Left Pan Right. Also known as Turntable.</item>
        <item name="Digits">Everyone in a circle. We will count from 1 to 10. Any player can start by saying \'1\'. Then any other player can say \'2\' and so one. If 2 players say a number at the same time we start all over again. Also known as No Doubles 1â€“10.</item>
        <item name="Ding">A scene is played. Whenever the MC ring a bell (or yells \'Ding\'), the player that is doing something/saying something needs to say/do something else.\n\n Doing \'something else\' is quite often interpreted as doing/saying the opposite of what you did before. One can be more creative, e.g. repeat what was said in a different emotion.\n\n If you use this as an exercise on Spontaneity the trainer can \'Ding\' quite often (very frustrating for the players, but they will come up with stuff they never would have thought of before). Disadvantage of this is that the story/characters tend to get lost. Use sparingly for performance. Also known as Other Choice.</item>
        <item name="DingCharacters">This is like Ding : players play a scene. When a bell is rang, they both need to drop into a completely different character, but the scene continues. This exercise is unlikely to lead to good scenes, but it\'s a great help to teach players to drop into clear and varied characters instantly.</item>
        <item name="DingDong">This is a variation on Day in the Life : pick an audience member and ask her some questions about her day. Then play that day. Every time the players \'guess\' something incorrect the volunteer says \'Dong\'. Players try to correct until they get a \'Ding\'.\n\n Example. Player is in bed in the morning and the alarm clock goes off: BZZZ. You get a \'Dong\'. Try again and alarm clock starts playing the radio. Another \'Dong\'. Try again and player is woken up by the neighbour drilling a hole in the wall. \'Ding\'. You got it. Continue with breakfast, and so on.</item>
        <item name="DirectorsCut">A normal improvised scene is played. At any moment a player not in the scene (or a player dedicated to this particular role) stops the scene ( see Cut ) and has the actors replay the scene with different emotions, characters, roles. Like a director instructing actors on how to play.</item>
        <item name="DisasterMovie">This is a Long Form format that can be played with a large number of players. Audience suggests a type of disaster (flood, earthquake, alien invasion, you name it) and a location where the play will unfold, preferably a location where lots of characters can be found. Examples are a tropical tourist paradise, a big building.\n\n The story starts right before the disaster, usually some character foreseeing the disaster, discovering a bad omen or some foretelling sign.\n\n Next we see lots of characters in the given location. These should be the archetypical characters one finds in typical disaster movies. Examples are:\n \nAn old couple that have been together for ever (they will die) \nA priest who might lead the survivors (he will die) \nA wacko scientist who will have a miracle solution to escape the disaster (he will die) \nA fallen-down hero, a die-hard ex-cop thrown out of the force, a retired fireman, an ex life-guard with a coke habit, you get the picture. He will rise up to the occasion and survive. \nA kid with loving parents (or a troubled teen not getting along with the parents) (the kid will survive, the parents will die \nSome sort of troubled, dysfunctional character set up to become the lover of the hero. \nWatch some disaster movies and pick your favorite cliche characters.\n\n Next, disaster strikes. Light, sound and smoke effects are a must. Why not use a musician with electric distortion guitar for added color. The following scenes show the characters in their quest to survive. Most will die (spectacularly). Feel free to provide background on the characters using flashbacks. Story ends with the hero + lover + kid (if available and/or still alive) escaping the carnage, ready and set to live happily ever after.</item>
        <item name="Disc1">Tell the players to imagine the stage is a disc, only supported right in the center of the stage. We are going to play a scene, in which the disc needs to be balanced at all times. Anytime a player moves, or a new player enters, the others need to rebalance the disc, and every move needs to be justified. Also known as Pivot. Another version of this game is Disc(2).</item>
        <item name="Disc2">Imagine the stage is a large disc, supported in the middle. The goal is to keep the disc balanced. Game starts with a player entering the disc; he is the leader. As soon as the leader stops milling about on the disc, another player must jump in and restore the balance. The new player becomes the new leader, and the previous leader becomes a follower.\n\n As soon as the balance is restored, the leader can start walking around; the other player stays where he is. As soon as the leader stops again, the follower(s) move and restore the balance. After that, the leader becomes one of the followers, and a new leader jumps in.\n\n The group of followers may split into groups of equal size, and restore the balance that way. Keep in mind that followers don\'t start moving until the leader stops.\n\n See also Disc(1).</item>
        <item name="Dissociation">This game can be done individually, or you can have one player do it in front of the class. Players say as many words that have nothing to do with each other, until they start associating. Restart as soon as you\'ve got an association.\n\n Example: cat, deodorizer, house, green, grass. Here we restart, because grass is obviously an association on green.\n\n You can use this game to show that association is natural, and that it is actually difficult not to associate. See also Malapropism.</item>
        <item name="DistanceGame">Two players stand a few feet apart facing each other and have the most boring 4-line interchange possible. They then each secretly pick a specific distance they want to be from the other person and repeat the interchange while maintaining the distance. The maintaining of distance automatically seems to affect people\'s emotional commitment and inflection. The key is to have a specific distance in mind down to the inch. If one person picks 1 foot but the other picks a foot and a half. You will see some interesting conflict because of that extra half a foot.\n\n As a variation, play a scene where the players are connected by a stick, a piece of rope or wood. You can even use a match stick.</item>
        <item name="DistortingMirror">This is a variation of the classic Mirror exercise. Played in pairs, one player is designated as the mirror. This mirror distorts the image; perhaps it blows everything up, makes everything wider, taller, smaller, narrower, prettier, uglier.</item>
        <item name="DoRonRon">4 players sing a improvised song about a subject, given by the audience, on the tune of Do Ron Ron.\n\n As a variation, invent your own choreography and have the players dance as they sing.</item>
        <item name="Documentary">This is a improv format that consists of monologues. The story is not played, but told. The players (typically 3 or 4) line up in front of the audience, Based on a single audience suggestion they all tell the same story, each as their own character in that story.\n\n The play usually starts with every character introducing him or herself. The order in which characters speak is not really important, as long as they all speak.\n\n After the introductions, things start to happen. Every character reflects on what is happening from their own perspective, and each character adds elements to the story.\n\n Keep going (and make sure that every character keeps contributing) and Reincorporating as long as things stay interesting.\n\n Also known as Spoon River or Moon River or Goon River. Sometimes known as Spork River, for the ridiculous.\n\n See also Voices From Heaven for a short form game version which is really based on the same handle.\n\n Origin unknown, but the story goes that the name of the format would be inspired by a book Spoon River by Edgar Lee Masters (hop on to www.outfitters.com/illinois/fulton/masters.html for more info on Spoon River).\n\n This is a great way of exercising monologues! Referring back to the work of Masters, many groups tend to end the format with the death of (one or more of) the character(s).</item>
        <item name="DontMessWithTextus">Ask the audience for a cellphone that has a long text (SMS) conversation on it. Then play a scene in one actor uses the text stream as his lines. Feel free to ask a suggestion for the scene, or just let one player (not the one with the cell phone) start the scene any way she wants. This game is similar to Actor\'s Nightmare.\n\n This game was invented by Recycled Minds. If you use it they appreciate an acknowledgement.</item>
        <item name="DooWop1">This is another structured song format, sung as a 1950\'s doo-wop. It can be structured in various ways. Here\'s one in 5 beats: ask for an object. Then:\n \nLead singer sings verse about the object \nAll sing Chorus, in the style of I love my (object) \nVerse 2: explain how you found your object \n(all) chorus on how you love your object \nVerse 3: That fateful night â€¦ explain how you lost your beloved object. This can be done as a parlando (i.e. you speak to the music, rather than sing) \n(bridge) Explain how bad you miss your object \n(all) chorus on how you miss your object \nVerse 4: explain how your replaced your object by a new (or other) one \n(all) chorus on how you love your new object (finale!) \nFeel free to drop e.g. the first of second chorus if you feel it drags you down. Feel free to modulate after the bridge, or not.</item>
        <item name="DooWop2">This is another structured long form. Get a topic, line up the players, and start improvising a song around the theme, usually without using a piano player (it would get too structured and cluttered if you so). Use the suggestion to improvise instruments (or their sound) with. Players can offer bits of Narrative by singing over the \'music\'. Once the narrative patterns are clean, any player can step out of the song and start a scene based on what was established.\n\n When the scene is done the \'music\' resumes till someone else starts a scene. Nice if the scenes start to connect, or if characters from different scenes meet and interact.\n\n This is a bit like a Harold but without the games. Or like a French Braid where the glue between the scenes is the song.</item>
        <item name="Doors">Excellent introductory exercise for building environments and Platform . All players in 2 rows. 2 facing players play the exercise, the others watch. Player 1 sets a (part of a) platform by miming a door. As soon as player 2 has an idea about where player 1 might be, player 2 steps into the scene and offers a line of dialog, expressing where we are. Player 2 answers player 1, acknowledging player 1\'s offer. This ends the scene.\n\n The audience should know after these 2 lines of dialog where the players are, and who they are, or what their relationship is to one another.\n\n \'Doors\' can be anything that separates one physical location from another. Players can mime real doors, but also gates, curtains, you name it. Encourage players to try out as many types of \'doors\' as possible. Use sound to enhance the platform, e.g. a door in a submarine makes a different kind of noise than an elevator door. See also Three Line Environment .</item>
        <item name="DoubleBlindFreeze">This is an extension of the Blind Freeze improv game: 2 players in scene, the others line up with their backs to the scene. Whenever the audience yells Freeze! the 2 players at the end of the line replace the 2 players on scene, and start a new scene, from the positions the original players were in.</item>
        <item name="DoubleEndowment">Another great game to train listening skills. Pick a place where a scene will be played, and 2 players. Tell each player what they need to get the other player to do, without the other player knowing this. Players are not allowed to explicitly tell the other player what to do.\n\n Example: an arena in ancient Rome. Player 1 needs player 2 to taste the sand in the arena, and player 2 needs to get player 1 to tie a knot in a lion\'s tail.\n\n Works best is players take risks. If they to the \'wrong\' thing the audience will probably just laugh, and that should be enough to signal the player he\'s going the wrong way.</item>
        <item name="DoubleOpening">2 players each make a (strong) opening sentence, at the same time. After that, adhering to both openings, find the scene that makes sense for both.\n\n As a variation, do the same, but have both players react to each other\'s opening simultaneously. Then have the original players react to the reaction simultaneously. Rather difficult, but teaches the importance of listening to one another.</item>
        <item name="DryCleaningBagOfDeath">We need three or four players for this improv game. During an improvised scene, one player is always off-stage, with his head inside a dry cleaning bag, slowly suffocating. He is not allowed out of the bag until some other player finds a way to exit the scene and \'liberate\' the suffocating player. New player puts his head into the bag until freed by another player, and first liberated player finds a way to justify his entrance into the scene. As a variation, use a bucket of water instead of a dry cleaning bag. Also known as Bucket of Death. Also known as Head in Bucket. .</item>
        <item name="DubbedMovie">2 or more actors play a scene, but they don\'t speak, although they can move their mouths as if they are speaking. 2 or more players sit in front of the action, and provide the speech.\n\n The effect is (or should be) like watching a dubbed movie.</item>
        <item name="DuckDuckGoose">Invent a name for a non-existing but simple children\'s game. As soon as you call out the name, all players start to play the game. They can use sounds and gibberish, but no real language. See if the group can come to playing along the same rules.\n\n As a variation, just have the group start playing the game, and afterwards have the group come up with the name.</item>
        <item name="DucksandCows">Great silly physical warm-up. Everyone closes eyes and trainer divides the group in 2 subgroups. Tap on right shoulder makes you a duck, and tap on left shoulder makes you a cow. Then eyes are opened and on the Go sign both groups try to find each other, by quacking and mooing.</item>
        <item name="Eights">Excellent game for warming up those muscles. Everybody scatter around, stand up relaxedly. Ask the players to make an \'8\' movement with their left big toe, then their left foot, then whole left leg. Repeat with right toe/foot/leg.\n\n Repeat with left index finger, left hand, left lower arm, left arm. Repeat with right hand/finger/arm. Try both arms. In opposite directions.\n\n Make 8-shaped movements with your pelvis. Try horizontally and vertically. Try changing direction.\n\n Ditto for left shoulder, right shoulder, both shoulders. Ditto for your head.\n\n End exercise by making eights simultaneously with as many parts of your body as possible.</item>
        <item name="Elephant">This one is like an extended version of Bippety Bop(1) . Start with 3 things:\n\nan Elephant, consisting of a trunk, made by the middle player, by holding your nose with one hand, and extending your other arm through the arm that holds the hand that holds the nose (does this make any sense?). The neighboring players each form a big ear, using both arms. Don\'t forget to attach the ears to the elephant\'s head. Make an elephant sound. \nA palm tree: the middle player is the tree, her neighbors become the waving leaves of the tree. Make windy noise \nA car: the middle player holds the steering wheel, the neighbors do the wheels. Make car engine noise.\n\n One player in the middle. Point to a person and yell Elephant (or Palm Tree, or whatever was agreed). Then choose another player and yell something else. Do this at high speed.\n\n Now for the extension: when someone makes a mistake, look at what the person does, and add that to the list of possibilities. For example, someone might be waving their arms incorrectly in from of them, trying to build the trunk of the elephant. If the group things this resembles, say, a swimmer, we decide on adding a swimmer to the list of options. Say the middle player does the arms and her neighbor do the legs. Repeat until you have so many options that everyone goes wrongâ€¦</item>
        <item name="EmotionLocationCircle">Participants gather in a circle. The first participant gives a random emotion and the second gives a random location. Play goes around the circle as each participant states an opening line someone might make if they had that emotion in that location. When everyone in the circle has given their statement, the next two people give an emotion and location.</item>
        <item name="EmotionReplay">Ask 2 players to play a short scene. One could limit the scene to 8 lines of dialog per player. Then ask the players to replay the scene, based on some audience suggestions for a particular emotion. This game is called different things depending on what type of suggestion is given.</item>
        <item name="EmotionalFamily">Usually played with 4 players, but can be done with more or less players. As a suggestion, ask for a family activity, then start a normal scene.\n\n As soon as all characters and their relationships have been established, freeze the scene, pick a player, and ask for an emotion for that player. The scene then continues, and the player is overcome with that emotion.\n\n Repeat till all players got an emotion. The scene has to keep evolving after each emotion assignment, and of course players shall try Justifying the emotions.</item>
        <item name="EmotionalManipulation">This is a great Accepting exercise, but it demands a certain level of Trust . This can also be used as a technique during Performance. The idea is to open a 2 player scene with a line of dialog that manipulates the other player\'s emotional state. This can be positive (Gee Robin, you look handsome today) or negative (Mary, have you been snacking again lately, I think you\'ve gained even more weight). Player 2 should accept this manipulation, and let it change the emotional state of her character.\n\n We mentioned Trust : it should be clear to the players that we are manipulating the emotions of characters, not the players themselves. Furthermore, the word \'manipulation\' may have a negative connotation for some - this is merely a technique, not intended to make others feel bad/sad/manipulated. Do not use this exercise unless the players have developed a great deal of trust; if this exercise makes a player uncomfortable, then stop the exercise.\n\n As a variation, this can be done as a one-person exercise as well: have the player say or do something that will manipulate her own character\'s emotional state.\n\n Another variation is to blurt out dialog to which the emotional reaction cannot be predicted (Honey I\'m pregnant) - but also in that case player 2 should react with a change in emotion. E.g. happy: That\'s so wonderful baby, we\'ve been trying for such a long time. Versus mad: You silly cow, don\'t tell me you forgot your birth control pills again. Versus sad: That makes me think of poor little Jimmy again, I miss him so much.</item>
        <item name="EmotionalMirror">Players in pairs, facing each other. One starts talking in gibberish, with a specific emotion (angry, happy, in love, you name it). The other instantly copies the emotion of the first player, and speaks in his own gibberish. No need to try and copy the other player\'s gibberish, and both players keep talking, no pauzing allowed. After about 10 seconds, the second player changes emotion, and the first one immediately follows her.</item>
        <item name="EmotionalQuadrants">Divide the scene in 4 quadrants, and allocate 4 different emotions to each quadrant. Players improvize a scene, but need to take on the emotion of the quadrant they are in. Encourage players to move about, in order to force changes of emotions. Don\'t forget to justify emotion changes.</item>
        <item name="EmotionsCharacters">Players in pairs, arms loosely hanging (not folded, not stuck in pant pockets). Players look at each other with pity. No words or sounds allowed, and no use of hands. Ask everyone to change partners. Players are asked to look at each other lustfully. Change partners again. Players are asked to look at each other joyfully.\n\n Then yell any of the three emotions. Players need to find back the partner with which they did that emotion and do it again. Repeat this several times. Then ask players to walk around the room. When they meet one of their 3 partners, they return to the look that went with that partner. In between partners they stay neutral. You can try more or different emotions, of course.</item>
        <item name="Endowments">This is a general handle for a ton of endowment games:\n \nOne player leaves, the audience gives an occupation, and this player need to be endowed with that occupation. Game is over once the occupation is guessed â€“ Also known as Occupation Endowment. \nAudience provides a location and a murder weapon (and perhaps an occupation for the victim as well). Player that was sent out needs to guess these â€“ Also known as Murder Endowment. . Attention â€“ this is not the same game as LCD. \nAudience provides 3â€“5 objects. Players try to endow the other player to use those object - Also known as Object Endowment. \n2 players. Audience provides a secret for both; players do not hear their own secret but know the secret of the other. Then they try to endow the other players with their secrets - Also known as Secrets Endowment. \nAudience provides a new brand of superhero. E.g. toothbrushwoman. Audience also provides 2 strengths and perhaps 1 weakness for this superhero. Others try to endow player one with the name, strengths and weakness of the new brand of superhero - Also known as Superhero Endowment.</item>
        <item name="Energy110">Everyone in a big circle, squatting down. We will count 1 to 10, all together, moving up, with increasing energy level. 1 is hardly audible, 10 is as loud as possible, everyone standing straight, hands reaching up.\n\n It\'s important to watch each other, to ensure we\'re all at the same energy level. Also make sure that the increase in energy is nicely gradual.</item>
        <item name="EvilStickOfGum">This is a variation on Little Voice . In this game one character has a piece of gum in her mouth, and this piece of gum is capable of talking.\n\n The point is that other characters in the scene do not know about this piece of gum, and hence mistake the gum\'s words for the characters. Since our piece of gum is evil, it tries to get it\'s owner in trouble.</item>
        <item name="EvilTwin">You need 4 players for this improv game. 2 will improvise a scene. The other players are the other\'s evil twins. At any point, the \'twins\' can shout \'freeze\' after which they tag out their twin, and continue the scene and do something evil. After that, they move out again, and the original twin brother needs to justify the evil, correct or repair the damage done and continue the scene.\n\n Great setups for this game are things like first dates, or meeting your in-laws for the very first time.</item>
        <item name="Evolution">Have the group in a circle. Everyone starts out as an egg and places their hands above their head and together so that they look like an egg. When you say go each person will find another egg. Once they found that person they will then farkle (Rock, Paper, Scissors). The loser stays an egg and the winner becomes a chicken, placing their arms as wings and making chicken noises. The chicken then looks for another chicken while the egg looks for another egg. When you win as a chicken you become a dinosaur, placing your hands out and roaring like a dinosaur. If you lose as a chicken you drop back down to an egg. Dinosaurs then find other dinosaurs, where they will play to become the ultimate people. Ultimate people put their hands over their heads like superman and look for others like them. If you lose as a dinosaur you go back to being a chicken, looking for other chickens. If the Ultimate person loses to another Ultimate person they go back to a dinosaur, and if they win they stay as ultimate people.</item>
        <item name="ExaggerationCircle">All players in a circle, or a long line. One player starts a little gesture, with or without a little sound.. The next player takes it over and makes it bigger. The last player does the whole thing to the extreme.\n\n Make sure the players stick to the original gesture/sound, and don\'t just do their own thing. We should be able to see the movement grow organically.</item>
        <item name="Excluding">4 players play a scene, in which one of the players gets excluded. This is a group exercise, in the sense that players should be sensing where the majority of the group is going (see Alien Tiger Cow ). Tell players not to be afraid of \'being nasty\' - be extreme in your exclusion (that makes it easier, also for the player that is excluded - see Mr. Nice Guy ). Whoever gets excluded should gladly accept this and react accordingly.\n\n Excluded players can go to extremes to be re-included - hilariously funny if even this is thoroughly ignored by the others.\n\n For a fun variation, see Alliances.</item>
        <item name="ExitGame">You need at least 3 players for this one. Give each player a word. Start playing a scene with 2 players. As soon as a player hears her word, she has to leave the scene. As soon as she hear her word again, she needs to walk into the scene again. Walkouts and re-entrances need to be justified.\n\n Also known as Walkout.</item>
        <item name="Flip">FLIP plays like CopyCat, except that you call \'FLIP\' or \'Freeze.\' CopyCat goes like a verbal Freeze Tag . A scene is started. At any time, a player at the side can step forward (the playing players hold off for a moment) and repeats a line that was said in the scene. Whoever originally said that line, steps aside, and the remaining players start a new scene starting with the line that was repeated. Feel free to actually continue the ongoing scene rather than to start a completely new one. Feel free to replace all the players instead of just the player who said the last line.</item>
        <item name="Faces">This is a Long Form that starts with a number of monologues, each based on a character created from a picture of a face, projected on stage.\n\n Assemble a series of pictures of faces, make sure the players do not get to see these before the performance. Pick 3â€“5 players, and randomly assign a face to each player. Audience provides input about the face, e.g. name of the character, motivations, desires, social background etc. The player then introduces the character in a monologue, building upon the image as well as the audience suggestions.\n\n Once all main characters have been introduced in the monologues, a series of scenes are played in which the characters that were introduced play the main parts. Players who play a \'faced\' character do not play other characters, but auxiliary players may play side characters (and may play more than one character).</item>
        <item name="FamilyPortraits">Fun game to get everyone to work together. Players are going to \'build\' family portraits. Ask for e.g. Family of accountants, bean counters; Family of fat/skinny people; Family of Pop Stars; Family of snakes, rats, cats; Family of garden tools.\n\n Tell the players you will want to see who\'s who in the family. We also want to see who gets along with who, who\'s the black sheep of the family, and so on. This only works if players watch each other closely.</item>
        <item name="FamousLastWords">MC asks the audience for famous (living or dead) people, or characters in movies, cartoons or songs. Players line up and invent \'famous last words\' for the subjects given by the audience.</item>
        <item name="FamousPersonEndowment">1 player gets a number of famous persons; one for each other player in the scene. Then a scene is played with all players, and player 1 endows the others with the personalities given by the audience.\n\n Sort of the inverse of The Party.</item>
        <item name="FastFoodLaban">Laban was a movement theorist, and this exercise is based on (a simplified form of some of) his ideas. Take 3 categories: \nTiming: Sudden or Sustained \nWeight: Heavy or Light \nSpace: Direct or Indirect\n\n Then try and make characters that behave/speak following combinations of the 3 categories: \npunching : sudden / heavy / direct \nslashing : sudden / heavy / indirect \nwringing : sustained / heavy / indirect \nstroking : sustained / light / indirect \ndabbing : sudden / light / direct \nsmoothing : sustained / light / direct \npushing : sustained / heavy / direct\n\n The attributes go with the characters, not necessarily with the actual performer\'s body. A heavyset person may move about delicately.\n\n As a variation, you can introduce this in a fairly simple way, by asking the players to move about the room, according to directions or orientations: \nbe a \'horizontal\' or \'vertical\' person \nbe downward, or upward \nbe light or heavy\n\n Then experiment with these: be suddenly light (bird taking off from a tree) or continuously light (be a cloud). You can do this using different kinds of music. What direction / weight / movement does a certain song or theme inspire? Then try to experiment with characters: who or what would be vertical person be (a general?). What/how would be continuously light person be (stoned?). Suddenly light (flirty?). See also Fast Food Stanislawski.\n\n Attributed to Keith Johnstone, author of Impro for Storytellers.</item>
        <item name="FastFoodStanislawski">Have 2 players perform a scene, perhaps give them a title or a location, but also give them a subtext for their character. Subtexts might be: \nyou want to seduce the other \nyou are a nerd \nyou like to make people laugh \nyou want to impress others \nyou are a nasty person \nyou try to be ordinary \nyou are an optimist/pessimist \nyou will never find a girlfriend/boyfriend\n\n If you are using this in a workshop it might be a good idea to ask the players how one would behave given a certain subtext. Stress that you are looking for Truthfulness. This is an excellent technique to find a character. You can actually use this for performance - just give yourself a subtext when you jump onto the stage and see what happens.\n\n Described in Impro for Storytellers: the book contains an appendix on how to play for different subtexts.</item>
        <item name="FastForward">For this handle we need a \'director\', or the MC can take on this role. A scene is started. The director can at any point interrupt the scene, and fast-forward (or backward) to another point in time. The story is then continued in that time. This technique employs both Flash Forward and Flashbacks. Also known as Rewind. See also Director\'s Cut.</item>
        <item name="FastMontage">Not to be confused with the generic format Montage . A Fast Montage is a technique to provide some Backstory . It works as follows: when a character makes a statement about her past, which is not already evident from the story so far, a series of Flashbacks are played to illustrate the dynamics of the information about that past. When done, the narrative continues from where it was before the Fast Montage.\n\n As an example: suppose a beggar makes the statement I used to be a rock star, a Fast Montage may show how the character become a rock star, and what happened to the rock star so that she is now a beggar. This might start with a flashback to the character\'s puberty, and continue from there on:\n \na quick scene where she hears someone play the guitar and decides she\'ll learn to play too \na quick scene where her boyfriend tells her she should try and publish the song she just performed \na quick scene where she celebrates her first record deal \na quick scene where she gives her \'thank you\' speech for winning her first grammy \na quick scene where she is snorting coke and partying hard \na quick scene where she gets arrested at an airport for drug possession \nand so on, further scenes that document her decline.\n\n In the succession of the flashbacks time runs forward linearly - he montage progresses logically forward through time. It is also important that the scenes are very short; the only purpose is to establish the next step in the character\'s story. Edit s between scenes should be fluent and organic and are typically not initiated by the main character (like a Revolving Door Edit ). The scenes should definitely *not* introduce other key characters - this is a montage about one character\'s past. And as soon as the montages have established the necessary Backstory to explain the character\'s current situation or state of mind, the main story continues.</item>
        <item name="FeatureFilm">This is a collection of improvised scenes, all based around (the making of) a movie. One character we definitely have in this improv format is a Director, who can direct the players to re-play poorly played scene, and who can offer parts of the storyline or Tilts . before they actually get played.\n\n Apart from seeing the scenes from the movie itself, we can (but don\'t have to) see scenes of what is going on behind the scenes (so you can have a totally different sub-plot going on there, if you want). Some groups also involve the guy that actually wrote the script (as in Typewriter ).\n\n Also known as At the Movies. Also known as At The Oscars, where we start the performance with an Oscar nomination (or win) for the Director.</item>
        <item name="FinalFreeze">This is an extension of Blind Freeze : players try to do callbacks from previous scenes in the Freeze. Recycle characters, situations, or even continue scenes that were frozen before.</item>
        <item name="FingerApplause">Have the audience clap not their hands, but start with 2 fingers. Then gently add more fingers until the whole hand is used.\n\n As a variation, try folks clap hands with their neighbors. Left hands up, right hands down; so every person claps his right hand into his neighbor\'s left hand and vice versa.</item>
        <item name="Fingertips">Played in pairs. Players touch all ten fingers, and one player closes her eyes. The other player leads the blind player by his fingertips. Make sure you have some obstacles in the room to navigate around/over/under.\n\n See also Blind Lead for a similar exercise.</item>
        <item name="FiringSquad">This is an association game, sometimes used in workshops to \'punish\' a silly or inattentive student.\n\n All players, except one, the victim, form a long line. The first player in the line throws any word to the victim, who responds as fast as he/she can with the first word that comes to mind. The next player in the line then throws another word, usually unrelated to the previous word, and again the victim needs to respond as fast as possible. Repeat till everyone has thrown a word.\n\n As a variation, this can be done as a continuation game: when done, the victim takes last place in the line, and the first player becomes the victim. You can even have multiple victims walking the line at the same time. Make sure there is enough \'space\' between the victims, otherwise, with the first hesitation, victims will start bumping into one another.</item>
        <item name="FirstLineLastLine">Get a line (any line) from the audience. Players play a scene that concludes with the given line. Try asking for a first line as well. Also known as First Line Last Line. .</item>
        <item name="FiveFourThreeTwoOne">This is a long form improv format, origin unknown, and has resemblance to a Harold. 5â€“4â€“3â€“2â€“1 can be played with 4 to 12 players. In this format the audience provides 5 different themes, objects, emotions, locations or situations. Then, the game is played in 5 rounds. In the first round 5 scenes are played, each based on one of the audience suggestions. These scenes are totally unrelated. After the first round the audience decides which of the 5 scenes seen should be discontinued. In the second round, the 4 remaining scenes are continued, and links start to appear between these scenes. Again, after this, the audience decides which scene to dump. This continues until after 4 rounds there are only 2 scenes left. In the fifth round these scenes come together in one final scene. This format can be played with or without props and/or director(s).\n\n As a variation, this can also be played without dropping a scene line. In that case you\'d probably use 3 rather than 5 scenes. Also known as Triptych. Also known as Tapestry.</item>
        <item name="FiveThings">One player leaves the stage while the Host asks for an everyday activity. Then, audience and host will change 5 things about that activity. Example: suggestion is feeding the cat. One might change the following:\n \nchange the cat into something else, say a tiger \nchange the verb into some other verb, say deep frying \nchange the location from where one might feed the cat. Say the Vatican. \nchange the character. Say character changes from cat-owner to postman \nadd interaction with a famous person, say Elvis.\n\n After that the 1st player is brought back in and a scene is played in Gibberish . The other players have exactly 5 minutes to make the first player guess each of the five things. Depending on the original suggestion, feel free to change whatever.</item>
        <item name="FlockDance">This is a physical warm-up. The group forms a pyramid: one player becomes the top, 2 players behind her, 3 players on a third line, and so on.\n\n The top player starts moving about the room (perhaps use music to guide the players). The second line follows the first player, and mimics her movements, and the third line follows the second line. The top player can alternate however she wants (and can be guided with e.g. a change in the music).\n\n The top player can even turn around, and face the second line. Confusion will be complete. Other variations can happen when the top player bumps into the last line, and takes over their movements. See also Aerobics.</item>
        <item name="FollowTheLeader">All but one in a circle, one player in the middle. The middle player closes her eyes, and the rest of the group quietly chooses a leader.\n\n Middle player opens her eyes and tries to find the leader. The whole group follows the leader, in everything he does. As soon as the middle player finds out who the leader was the game is over.\n\n This only works if movements are clear, not too fast, and if the group \'follows the leader\' as fast and as precisely as possible.</item>
        <item name="FollowTheLeaver">Start a scene with at least 2 characters. This is long form, so feel free to edit to different scenes, in different time periods. Each player sticks to playing one character.\n\n whenever a character leaves the scene, the audience may yell follow the leaver. At this point all characters remaining on stage disappear, and the story continues with the character who just left the scene, and a totally different story line is allowed to develop. Characters from the previous scene do not appear in this next scene and the players may play different characters (except for the leaver\'). This continues until one of the characters leaves and the audience yells follow the leaver.\n\n\nTypically characters from older scenes do not return, though this is not a rule set in stone; the format really allows sequential story lines that do not connect later on.</item>
        <item name="FollowYourNose">Silly physical warm-up. Have everybody mill around the room, and shout a body part. Players then start moving around as if they are leaded by that body part. Continue with another body part.\n\n End the game on a really silly note by leading with e.g. your internal organs. Also known as Foot Soldiers.</item>
        <item name="FootSoldiers">Silly physical warm-up. Have everybody mill around the room, and shout a body part. Players then start moving around as if they are leaded by that body part. Continue with another body part.\n\n End the game on a really silly note by leading with e.g. your internal organs. Also known as Follow Your Nose.</item>
        <item name="ForeignMovie">2 players play an improvised story in Gibberish, 2 others translate. The idea is to build the story together: the \'actors\' give elements to the translators, and the translators can help steer the action for the \'actors\'. Also known as Subtitles.</item>
        <item name="FortuneCookie">Open a fortune cookie, read it aloud. Then improvize a scene based on the fortune.\n\n As a variation, give every player a fortune cookie; each player then need to show that fortune in his or her character.</item>
        <item name="FortuneTeller">One player covers his ears while the others get \'predictions\' from the audience; one prediction per other player. First player then plays a fortune teller who must be endowed by the others to predict the given predictions.\n\n As a variation, off-stage players can posses (like as ghosts) the fortune teller and give him or her tips.</item>
        <item name="FreeAssociation">This is the classic association exercise. There are various ways of playing this (see Variations and see other games in the Association category.\n\n In a free association we will ask players to say the first thing they think about when hearing (or seeing, feeling, smelling or tasting) anything another player provides.\n\n It should be stressed that anything is valid, as long as it is not preconceived: the association should be based on what the previous player has offered.</item>
        <item name="FreeAssociationCircle">Everyone in a circle and we establish a rhythm, by swinging a hand. Once a rhythm is established, one player starts by tossing a word to his neighbor, who associates on the word and tosses another word to his neighbor.\n\n It\'s important to stay in the rhythm. Tell the players to just say \'banana\' if they feel they can\'t think of a word, as long as the rhythms does not get broken. See also Word Ball and Clap Snap Association.\n\n Try this in combination with Last Letter . See Blind Association Circle for another variation.</item>
        <item name="FreeAssociationLines">Yet another way to play association games. Place all players on 2 lines, facing each other. One player starts walking to another player in the other line. Just before he gets to that other player, he throws her a word. The receiver starts crossing the line towards someone else, and the first player takes her place in the line. The receiver now becomes the thrower, throwing the first word she can think of to another player, who then starts walking, and so on.\n\n Try with 2 or more walkers at the same time. Many players, especially new ones, tend to find it easier to freely associate when there are multiple walkers: they feel less \'on the spot\' (as no-one is watching them in all the commotion) and they don\'t really have the time to get in their heads. Can be combined with Last Letter.</item>
        <item name="FreeFalling">Nice, but a bit dangerous exercise to build trust. In it\'s simplest (and safest) form all players stand in a circle, one player in the middle. The player in the middle closes her eyes, slowly turns around, and then lets herself fall backwards (or forwards). The other players need to catch her.\n\n If you\'re careful, here\'s a variation: have one player stand on a chair or a table, the others in front of him. Player closes his eyes and lets himself fall, hopefully he will be caught by the others.</item>
        <item name="FreeFormImprov">Free-form is what it says on the box: improv with no rules. This typically refers to narrative Long Form without a particular format: just ask for a suggestion and start playing scenes. Anything goes: scenes or story line may or may not be related, scenes may all be inspired by the original suggestion, or may be inspired by what happened in previous scenes.</item>
        <item name="FreezeTag">2 actors start an improvised scene. At any point in time another player can call Freeze. This player then tags out one of the 2 actors, and takes his place. Both players then start a new scene, justifying their positions.\n\n The way this improv game is played quite often goes a bit against good improv, as many groups hardly take the time to develop a story line. If played this way, it\'s more a game of wit, and you would probably use it early in a show as an audience (and player) warm-up.\n\n Alternatively, you can take your time and play every scene for several minutes, see what develops, and only at the end of each scene tag into another scene.\n\n To avoid preconceptions, see Blind Freeze. See also Space Jump for an extension of this game.</item>
        <item name="FrenchBraid">This is a very simple format, which consists of a number of (unrelated) scenes, that get interrupted, and then continues at a later point.\n\n It is played as follows: 2 or more players start a scene. At any time, when another player or players enters the stage, the scene is interrupted (or fades out) and the new player(s) start a new scene. This is repeated until all players have played.\n\n Then the series is restarted with the first scene. This scene continues, or starts at a later point in time (or later in the story, like a Fast Forward ). The scene gets interrupted again, and so forth. The whole is repeated several times.\n\n This is typically played without a director - the players decide when to interrupt an ongoing scene. Players typically play one character.</item>
        <item name="FrontDesk">We improvise a scene, set in the lobby of a hotel. One or more players play the receptionist(s) and the others play guests arriving or checking out, bell boys, repairmen, you name it.\n\n Players construct the environment together - as soon as a door, a plant, a desk or whatever is \'placed\' by any player, all other players should respect it. See also Group Environment.</item>
        <item name="FruitBasket">All players but one sitting a circle, one person in the middle. The person in the middle calls out a category or some descriptive that might apply to some or all of the other players. E.g. all women, all blondes. When called, if a player matches the description must leave her chair and find another chair. Person that doesn\'t find a chair becomes the next in the middle. When \'Fruitbasket\' is called, everyone changes chairs.</item>
        <item name="FuneralService">This improv game handle can be used both as a Long Form format and as an exercise. The stage is set up as a funeral, or a viewing the night before the funeral. One player is the deceased, bang in the middle and very visible in or on e.g. a table or a couple of chairs representing the casket.\n\n Audience suggests an odd or peculiar way to die, and then the death is played. Perhaps characters present during the funeral service were there at the time of death. After death, the dead gets back into her coffin and we return to the service.\n\n Then, taking turns, guests at the funeral service step up and present, in a monologue, their experience with the deceased. After each monologue what was described is played, like a flash-back.</item>
        <item name="Fusillade">Great exercise in fast thinking, but seen done in performance as well. Would be an excellent challenge for a theater sports match!\n\n All players line up in 2 lines, facing each other. MC or trainer yells a word/title, and next player in line gets 30 secs to do his or her thing, based on the suggestion. After 30 seconds new title/word is given and next player goes.</item>
        <item name="FuzzyDucky">Silly concentration game and great warm-up. All players in a circle. We will count numbers clockwise, except that:\n \nany number that is a multiple of 3, or contains a 3 (like 13) becomes \'Fuzzy\' \nany number that is a multiple of 7 or contains a 7 (like 17) becomes \'Ducky\' \nany number that is a multiple of 3 and 7 (like 21) or contains both 3 and 7 (like 73 and 37) becomes \'Fuzzy Ducky\')\n\n Any player that ends up muttering \'Duzzy Fucky\' is put in front of the Firing Squad.</item>
        <item name="GameOMatic">This is like \'invent-your-own-game\' : ask the audience for the name of an unexisting improv game, then invent the rules on the spot, and play it.\n\n Kind of risky, but if the group has been playing short form improv games for quite a while, coming up with rules is easy.</item>
        <item name="Gaston">Players take turns adding lines to the chorus of the song Gaston from Disney\'s Beauty and the Beast, adding a different verb into the line. The new verbs all must match. The last line does not have to rhyme, but must make sense of the previous three lines. For example:\nNo one walks like Gaston!\nNo one talks like Gaston!\nNobody ever fixes clocks like Gaston!\nHe\'s good at mechanics and basic movement.\nOh what a guy, Gaston! </item>
        <item name="GibberishCommands">Another exercise on Jabbertalk : players in pairs. Have each play issue a command to her partner, in Gibberish. Players can\'t move on until the command is understood and executed. Simple things will do, like \'pass me the salt, please\'.\n\n The idea is not to mime the command, but to try and make it obvious for the way the command is issued, and the environment that has been set.</item>
        <item name="GibberishDictionary">This is best played with an odd number of players. Everyone in a circle. The first player gives a gibberish word to her right neighbor, who translates the word. The next player provides the next gibberish word, and so on.\n\n As a variation, the receiver can provide both the translation, and a new gibberish word. You may want to add the origin of the language along with the translation.\n\n Any gibberish word might be translated as \'banana\' of course, but that is not the idea of the exercise. For your translation, use the first thing that comes to mind. You may be inspired by the whole sound of the word (it might sound like something \'known\'), or parts of the word (only the vowels, or only the consonants), or by the intonation of the \'giver\', or even by her expression or body language. Try gibberish in different \'languages\' or \'accents\'. Also known as Translate Gibberish.</item>
        <item name="GibberishExpert">One player is an expert on a subject, often provided by the audience. Furthermore, he\'s from a foreign country (perhaps also supplied by the audience). The expert gives a lecture in Gibberish and a second player translates.\n\n As a variation, have the expert tell a story, instead of giving a lecture.</item>
        <item name="GibberishMalapropism">This exercise flexes your mind and is a good exercise for Gibberish games. Have the players walk about in the room, point to any object, and give it another name in Jabbertalk. See also Malapropism.</item>
        <item name="GiveAndTake">This is a variation on Walking by Numbers : all players find a position the room. One person must always make sound and one person must walk. This can be the same person who is walking and making sound but it could be one person walking while a different person is making sound.\n\n The focus can be given (i.e. a walker stops walking) or can be taken (i.e. someone else starts walking; the original walker must stop then). Feel free to try with multiple walkers.</item>
        <item name="Goalie">Great high-tempo exercise. 1 player up front. He\'s the goalie. The other players all think of an opening line for a scene, and a character. When everyone has their opening line and character, we bombard the goalie with these offers, one at a time. Goalie needs to react right away to an offer, acknowledging the opening and character, snap into an opposite character and reply to the opening. Immediately after that the next player comes up with his or her offer.\n\n This exercise is good for teaching players to react right away, and to snap into a character almost without thinking.</item>
        <item name="GoodBadWorst">Three players stand on stage as an advice panel and make up characters based on a suggestion from the audience. The audience then asks questions of the advice panel. The three will give good advice, bad advice, and the worst advice imaginable. No matter what the bad says, the worst is worse.</item>
        <item name="GoonRiver">This is a improv format that consists of monologues. The story is not played, but told. The players (typically 3 or 4) line up in front of the audience, Based on a single audience suggestion they all tell the same story, each as their own character in that story.\n\n The play usually starts with every character introducing him or herself. The order in which characters speak is not really important, as long as they all speak.\n\n After the introductions, things start to happen. Every character reflects on what is happening from their own perspective, and each character adds elements to the story.\n\n Keep going (and make sure that every character keeps contributing) and Reincorporating as long as things stay interesting.\n\n Also known as Spoon River or Moon River. Sometimes known as Spork River, for the ridiculous. Also known as Documentary.\n\n See also Voices From Heaven for a short form game version which is really based on the same handle.\n\n Origin unknown, but the story goes that the name of the format would be inspired by a book Spoon River by Edgar Lee Masters (hop on to www.outfitters.com/illinois/fulton/masters.html for more info on Spoon River).\n\n This is a great way of exercising monologues! Referring back to the work of Masters, many groups tend to end the format with the death of (one or more of) the character(s).</item>
        <item name="GorillaTheatre">This format is played with 3 experienced players, one MC and another player, dressed up as a Gorilla. The Gorilla is the prize to be won; the best player of the evening gets to spend a week with the Gorilla, and of course this is quite a privilege!\n\n The Gorilla enters with last week\'s winning player (real or faked). The MC explains that the score for the evening will be counted by means of bananas; the player that end up with most bananas at the end of the game wins another week with the Gorilla. The audience is trained to \'vote\' by yelling \'Banana\' (for a good performance) or something else, like \'Die\' or \'Forfeit\' for a bad performance.\n\n Each scene is then played by 2 players, and directed by the third. The beauty of it all is the fact that not the players are judged by the audience, but the director.\n\n Players take turns directing, and after each game the audience either awards the director a banana, or a forfeit. Bananas are pinned on a scoreboard, or pinned onto the winning player\'s costume - cardboard bananas are preferable in the latter case. A forfeit is like a punishment for a poorly directed scene. Possible forfeits might be calling your mom and explaining why you\'ve been such a lousy director, or having to sing a song about your bad scene.\n\n The director gets to choose the scene or the game to be played. Perhaps a list of games to be played this night is on the stage, and directors can write their names next to the games they want to direct. The director directs the scene, gives players side-coachings, can interrupt the scene, introduce tilts or make the players repeat (part of) the scene. To ensure that bad scenes don\'t drag on forever, or to prevent directors to play tons of 30-second scenes in order to improve their chances, certain troupes limit the amount of time for directing to like 20 minutes per player. This format can be played with or without attributes and props. The Gorilla might even be used as a prop, or even as a player, although the Gorilla should not try and steal the show. The Gorilla is a player, so he too should be prepared to take risks, and he\'s supposed to be naughty.\n\n This is a fairly advanced format, as the players not only need to play well, they also need enough insight to effectively direct scenes. This is also a rather nice format, as players are not rewarded; 2 players playing well together generate a banana for the director, and this way the format prevents competition between the players.\n\n Attributed to Keith Johnstone, and described in Impro for Storytellers.</item>
        <item name="GreatestHits">This game was made famous by the TV show Who\'se line Is It Anyway. Typically played with 4 players. 2 of these are the hosts of a tv commercial, trying to sell a CD compilation of \'greatest hits\'. Audience suggestion is the theme of the CD. E.g. a profession: accountants. The CD to be sold is then Songs for Accountants. For all you digital kids, instead of a CD it might just as well be a record in the iTunes store.\n\n The hosts discuss the CD, why viewers should buy it, and select 3â€“4 tracks. Each track gets a title and a style, e.g. (for accountants) The IRS blue - which in this case also implies the style. The other players then improvise that song, in that style. For examples, do a search on youtube for WLIIA Greatest Hits.\n\n See also CD Shop.</item>
        <item name="Greetings">All players start milling about the room. You then ask them to greet each other, perhaps just by shaking hands. Players just shake hands, move on, and greet the next player they meet. Then ask the players to greet each other in a more specific way. Possibilities are:\n \ngreet each other like you greet a long lost friend \ngreet someone you don\'t really trust \ngreet an ex-lover \ngreet someone you really hate \nsomeone you have a secret crush on \nsomeone you had a one-night stand with \nsomeone that sold you a crappy used car \nsomeone with bad breath \ngreet someone like you are a cowboy, a soldier, a nanny, a Russian farmer,â€¦\n\n Also known as Hello. Also known as Lost Friend. See also Presents .</item>
        <item name="GroundControl">4 players. 2 players will be Ground Controllers, the other 2 provide the dialog in the scene. Each player has one ground controller assigned to them. The Ground Controllers use flashlights (preferably with cones attached like they use at airports) to direct the movement of the players. The players can not move unless directed by the ground controller. To mix things up, try using audience members to play the Ground Controllers.\n\n Note, a prop is needed: Flashlight with affixed cone like they use on the runway at airports. Players need to be ready to justify why they are moving about on stage and not simply just walk back and forth. Movement of the flashlight left or right will more the players left or right on stage. Consider flashlight movement up and down can move the player up and down stage or cause them to climb or crawl.\n\n Contributed by Scared Sciptless Improv.</item>
        <item name="GroupEnvironment">This is a group exercise in building environments. One player starts by entering a \'space\' through a \'door\', and then leaves that space, through the same or through another door. Any doors placed remain where they are, and the characteristics of the door are not to change. Then another player enters the same space, and places a mimed object in that space, either by physically placing the object ( carrying, wheeling or pushing it into the space, or by just \'using\' it, for example by hanging her coat over a chair. Second players leaves the room, either through one of the established doors, or by placing a new exit.\n\n This continues until every player has done their thing. Each player needs to respect, and perhaps use all objects placed by previous players.\n\n Watch for players Gagging - anyone placing a jukebox in what has clearly been defined as a church is just trying to be funny and screwing up the scene.</item>
        <item name="GroupFreeze">Everyone starts milling about the room. Any player may decide to stop walking at any time. As soon as one player stops walking, everyone needs to freeze in position. As soon as everyone is froze, start walking again. Obviously, the idea is for the group to freeze as quickly as possible.\n\n As a variation, let all players make noises, hum, whistle as they mill about. The noisier, the more challenging the exercise becomes. Also known as Statues. See also Walking by Numbers.</item>
        <item name="GroupMirror">Everyone in a big circle, facing each other. They can move (arms, legs, eyebrows) slowly, and all the other players will mirror them. This is a game of give and take - no-one should be (continuously) leading. Keep movements slow.</item>
        <item name="GroupOrder">Nice warm-up exercise to help the group function/agree as a whole. Everybody starts milling about the room. You then ask them to line up, according to various criteria. Examples are:\n \norder by age \norder by weight \norder by shoe size \norder by mental health \norder by personal hygiene \norder by number of ex-lovers \norder by blue\n\n Keep the silly criteria (order by blue) till the end. Usually, the players will start realizing that it doesn\'t really matter what the order is, as long as the group agrees on the order. Criteria like mental health or personal hygiene are quite interesting to train on Chivalry .\n\n See also Blind Line Up .</item>
        <item name="GrowingAndShrinkingMachine">The game starts with one person improvising a solo scene. At some point, as second player enters, and with the first player, starts a new scene. This continues, more players entere one at a time, each time transforming the scene into something new. Once the game reaches capacity, the players reversed their entrances, reverting to previous scenes. When previous scenes are continues, these continue later in time.</item>
        <item name="GuestGame">In this improv game we play a scene in which one player is a guest, somewhere. We do not know who he is, or why he is visiting, or what his relation might be with the characters at the location. All other characters in the scene behave strangely or suspiciously, as if they have a secret. The idea is that by the end of the scene we understand their secret.\n\n For example, a player might ring a doorbell at a house, ready to pick up his date. We never get to see the date, and all characters in the scene slowly provide hints as to what might have happened to the date. The game is over when e.g. we (the audience) discover that all occupants of the house have been hauling garbage bags out of the hous, all containing body parts of the dateâ€¦ It need not always be gruesome, thoughâ€¦</item>
        <item name="HaSohKah">This is a fun warm-up game, and a good one to teach players to deal with failure. We are going to say Ha-Soh-Kah; all players in a circle. The player that starts with Ha holds her hand, horizontally, near her forehead. The next player is the one her fingers are pointing to (left or right; first player can choose which hand to use and which direction to point to). Next player says Soh, hand horizontally, near the chin, pointing again, either to the left or to the right. The player the Soh points to does Kah, and points with both hands to the next player, who does a Ha again, and so forth.\n\n When someone makes a mistake, the whole group says rhythmically: You are out of this game. Whoever is out steps out of the circle and tries to make the remaining players make a mistake.</item>
        <item name="HalfLife">Ask 2 players to play a short scene. The scene is timed to 60 seconds. Then ask the players to replay the scene in 30 seconds, then in 15 seconds and so on. This is also known as Countdown.\n\n As a variation, you can limit the number of lines each player says and reduce that with each replay.\n\n Alternatively, have the scene replayed by 2 other players or insist that the dialog remains exactly the same.\n\n</item>
        <item name="HallOfJustice">Fun game for 5+ players, involving superheroes and villains. Get 4 suggestions from he audience, e.g. hammer, coffee, influenza and briefcase. This will give us 2 superheroes: Hammerman and his sidekick coffeewoman. We will also have 2 villains: influenzaman and his aide briefcasegirl. The other players play the villain\'s victims. Villains and heroes should try and use as many attributes of their suggestion as they justifiably can.</item>
        <item name="HandSlap">All players in a circle, down on the floor. Cross arms, and then put hands flat on the ground. Each hand in turn pats/slaps the ground, in order. Hands that miss are eliminated.</item>
        <item name="HandicappedFairyTale">Very silly but very effective. Ask the audience for a fairy tale. Then give every player one or more characters in the story. Ask for a handicap or peculiar state of mind for each character and improvise the fairy tale.</item>
        <item name="Hands">Get everyone into a circle, holding hands. One player starts the game by squeezing the hand of one of his neighbors. The receive then squeezes the hand of his other neighbor, thus generating a \'squeeze wave\' through the circle.\n\n As a variation, squeezes can run in different directions, and you can have more than one squeeze wave cycling through the circle at a time. Instead of squeezing, you can make players communicate by pressing (or even slapping) hands together. Squeezes can run at different rates - this can be controlled by letting nobody squeeze their neighbors as long as the squeeze they receive is not over yet. You can have one player try to \'detect\' the squeeze (try and squeeze as unnoticeably as possible).\n\n Also known as Squeezer.</item>
        <item name="Harold">Harold is a long format, and consists of a number of sub-formats. It basically consists of 3 components: scenes with 2 to 4 players, games, and monologues. The format starts with a suggestion from the audience - this could really be anything. Players will start associating around the suggestion, and then an opening game is played. In this game, a lot of associated elements round the audience suggestion are presented. The opening game might be a song, a monologue, or simply a group association based on the audience suggestion. The idea is to use the elements and themes that come up or about in the opening game in what follows.\n\n Then follow 3 rounds of scenes, all based on the themes found in the opening game. Each round exists out of 3 scenes, all unrelated, but each loosely based on the themes and associations form the opening game. Since these themes originated for the same audience suggestion, the audience will (hopefully) feel some links between the scenes. After the first round of 3 scenes, an improv game is played; this game is unrelated to the 3 scenes played before. Then, in the second round, each of the 3 previous scenes is continued, and more or less obvious links between the scenes start to emerge. This is again followed by an improv game, and then the 3 scenes are played into a conclusion. It\'s quite possible that in the third round not every scene is continued; scenes may disappear or even merge with one another.\n\n A Harold can be played with a decent number of players (up to 12 or so), players can act in multiple scenes, as the same or as different characters. A Harold can be played with or without props, with or without directors. Whether one sticks to the 3 rounds or not is really not relevant; anything and any combination of games and loose scenes that finally more or less come together can be considered a Harold.\n\n This is an American format, described in Del Close\'s book Truth in Comedy. We\'re not sure whether it\'s copyrighted - if you know please let us know.</item>
        <item name="HatContinuation">Start a scene, and identify each of the characters by means of a hat. The MC will interrupt (freeze) the game from time to time, and switch the players\' hats. After the switch each player becomes the character that previously wore his or her hat. The story needs to continue and should make sense. \n\nA gimmick is Commenting on the fact that characters \'jump\' in space when the hats gets switched. Use sparingly. \n\nAlso known as Bermuda Triangle.</item>
        <item name="Hats">A very silly game. 2 improvisers put on hats, preferably similarly sized. Scene ends when one player grabs the other player\'s hat or tries to do so and misses. Any grab, move to grab or defensive movement needs to be fustified. Try and play the scene for reality. \n\nAs a variation, start with a 20 second window in which no grabs are allowed, so that the scene and the relationships between the characters can evolve.</item>
        <item name="HauntedHouse">A number of players stand in the middle of the room, eyes closed the others stand by the walls. One of the middle players is tapped on the shoulder, she become the \'killer\' or the \'vampire\'. The trainer give a go-sign, and all \'blinded\' players start milling around the room. When the killer bumps into someone, she squeezes that persons forearm to \'kill\' him. When a victim dies, he utters a scream, opens his eyes and is \'out\'. \nGame is over when all potential victims are dead. \n \nAudience by the walls make sure that blind players don\'t bump into stuff or hurt themselves. \n \nAs a variation, when a \'vampire\' runs into a victim, the victim becomes a vampire too \nWhen 2 vampires bump into one anther, they become normal mortal souls again \nAlso known as Blind Hunt. Also known as Screamers. Also known as Haunted House. Also known as Blind Stalker. Also known as Vampire Game. See also Death and Retriever</item>
        <item name="HeSaidSheSaid">Excellent game to show how Endowment works. 2 players; each player will state the action the other player must perform, followed by his own line. \nExample: \n \n1: I want a divorce \n2: She said, while grabbing a knife from the kitchen table. At this point player 1 needs to take a knife. Player 2 continues with his own line. Sure Honey \n1: He said, while turning to the sports page of the paper. Now, it\'s quite clear that player 2 should be paying more attention to the paper than to his wife. Player 1 continues with her own line. You\'re not listening to me \nand so on. \nPlayers refer to each other as \'he\' and \'she\', and endow each other with the next action to take. This can be quite funny, if you endow your partner to do crazy or not-so-nice things to you (or to themselves, but that\'s would not be Mr. Nice Guy ). \n \nAs a variation, can be done with 4 players: 2 provide the lines, and the 2 others provide the \'directions\' - each director provides the action for one of the 2 talkers. \nCan also be one with 3 players: one provides directions and both other players do their own dialogs. \n \nKeep the action do-able and active. Making someone else \'think about something\' is hard to play, and not very active. Also known as He Said While She.</item>

        <item name="HeadInBucket">We need three or four players for this improv game. During an improvised scene, one player is always off-stage, with his head inside a dry cleaning bag, slowly suffocating. He is not allowed out of the bag until some other player finds a way to exit the scene and \'liberate\' the suffocating player. New player puts his head into the bag until freed by another player, and first liberated player finds a way to justify his entrance into the scene. \nAs a variation, use a bucket of water instead of a dry cleaning bag. Also known as Bucket of Death. Also known as Head in Bucket.</item>
        <item name="HeaveHo">This is like an extended version of Tossing to be played with 16+ players. All players but one form 2 lines, facing each other, and link hands to form a platform, which is used to heave the last player from one end of the line to the other. \nBest to remove shoes, coins, and any other objects that might fall or hurt someone.</item>
        <item name="Hello">All players start milling about the room. You then ask them to greet each other, perhaps just by shaking hands. Players just shake hands, move on, and greet the next player they meet. Then ask the players to greet each other in a more specific way. Possibilities are: \ngreet each other like you greet a long lost friend \ngreet someone you don\'t really trust \ngreet an ex-lover \ngreet someone you really hate \nsomeone you have a secret crush on \nsomeone you had a one-night stand with \nsomeone that sold you a crappy used car \nsomeone with bad breath \ngreet someone like you are a cowboy, a soldier, a nanny, a Russian farmer,.. \nAlso known as Hello. Also known as Lost Friend. See also Presents.</item>
        <item name="HelpingHands">Scene played by 4 players, playing 2 characters. Each character consists of one player, who does the voice, holding his hands behind his back. Another player stands behind player 1, and provides the \'hands\'. \nThe story should be a give and take between voices and hands. Also known as Arm Game. n \n \nAs a variation, have 2 players provide the arms, one each.</item>
        <item name="Hesitation">In this game a scene is played, in which at any time, any player may \'hesitate\', and ask the audience for help. Anything provided by the audience must be justified and incorporated. \nExamples: \n \nJames, hand me that.. (signs the audience for a word) â€” Lollypop. \nAh, I was sailing the 7 seas in my.. Newspaper. Yes, Newspaper, finest vessel ever built byâ€¦ (martians)</item>
        <item name="Hijacker">Excellent improv game to train listening skills. \n4 players, one leaves the room. Pick a means of transportation, and an object. The idea is that player number 4 needs to guess the means of transportation, and then use the object to hijack the others. Finally pick a goal for the hijacker to achieve. \n \nThe players need to provide hints to the hijacker, but they cannot explicitly tell the hijacker what to do, with what or why. Also known as Rebel without a Clue. \n \nWorks best is players take risks. If they to the \'wrong\' thing or use the wrong object the audience will probably just laugh, and that should be enough to signal the player he\'s going the wrong way.</item>
        <item name="HistoricalReplay">Ask 2 players to play a short scene. One could limit the scene to 8 lines of dialog per player. Then ask the players to replay the scene, based on some audience suggestions for: \na particular emotion. Also known as Emotion Replay. \nan era. Also known as Through the Ages. Also known as Historical Replay. \na different location \na film / TV / literature style. Also known as Style Replay. \nin Gibberish \nbackwards. Also known as Backwards Scene. \nAs a variation, you can time the scene to 1 minute, and then replay in 30 seconds, 15 seconds, 7 seconds and 3 seconds. \nThis variation is Also known as Countdown. and Also known as Half Life. \n \nOther variations: \n \nhave the scene replayed by 2 other players \ninsist that the dialog remains exactly the same \nSee also Replay Gibberish.</item>
        <item name="HitchHiker">Use 4 chairs to build the interior of a car. One player starts driving the car, and another player becomes a hitch hiker, hiking a ride. The hitch hiker character has a particular character tick or particular emotion, which the driver takes over. \nOther hitch hikers join in, each with their own characteristics or emotions, taken over by the driver and the passengers in the car as the hiker joins. When the car is full, one of the players leaves the car to make room for the new guest. \n \nDon\'t forget to justify leaving the car.</item>
        <item name="HoneyWalk">This is a group exercise. Tell the players they have an oxygen mask, and then talk them through the exercise: players are to move about in successively thicker substances. Go from thin air, mist, warm water, oil, honey, Jell-O, wet cement to hard cement. \nEnd the game by having them \'frozen\' in cement and break out with a big bang. \n \nCoach the players to imagine really moving about these substances. They should be able to \'feel\' the mist between their fingers, the honey in their hair.</item>
        <item name="Horoscope">Take a magazine with a horoscope. Ask an audience member for their birthday, read their horoscope and then improvise a scene based on that horoscope. \nCan be combined with Day in the Life.</item>
        <item name="HotSpot">All players in a circle. One player steps into the circle and starts singing a known song. As soon as this player shows any signs of stopping (because she doesn\'t know the lines any more, gets tired or embarrassed) another player needs to step in and take over (singing a different song). \nThis exercise is not about improvising songs, but more of a group thing. Players need to know that the group will support them when they\'re out of breath. The idea is to keep singing.</item>
        <item name="HouseCreatureFlood">Players form a house, in which one other player is a creature. When trainer calls house the house players make a new house over the creature. When trainer calls flood everyone moves about and finds another position.</item>
        <item name="HumanKnot">Have the players stand in a tight circle, with their hands in the center. Then have them grab other hands at random. The puzzle is for the whole group to work together to get themselves untangled. Sometimes youâ€™ll find that the group has actually formed several smaller circles.</item>
        <item name="HumanProps">Excellent exercise for building environments and object work. Ask one player to start doing an activity that somehow defines (broadly) a location. E.g. when someone starts typing she might be in a (home) office. The other players then become the other objects in the environment. \nTell the first player she can start using the props built by other players in the environment (if she recognizes them). Tell players to go for the obvious: in just about any room you could be a plant, a door or a table, after all. \nWhen done, ask the first player to name any \'object\' built in the environment. \n \nAs a variation, you can use this as a handle for a performance. When a player is asked to sit down, and there are no chairs on the scene, another player can become the chair for the first player to sit on. Other examples are ticking clocks in haunted houses, cabinets and closets, you name it.</item>
        <item name="ID">Ask a number of Ids, driver\'s licences from audience members. Improvise a scene in which the ncharacters are based on the Ids. The host may ask these folks questions about their lives. See also Day in the Life.</item>
        <item name="ILoveYou">A simple song structure for 2 singers. Singer 1 sings 4 lines; the first 3 are about the other character; line 4 is simply I love you. Then player 2 does the same about the first character. May rhyme but that\'s not a must. \nAfter that, the 2 parts are repeated, but interweaved, one player at a time, and ending, singing together, with I love you. \n \nExample: \n \nPlayer 1: You sing so well, You dance so great, You act so fine, and I love you \nPlayer 2: Your voice is so deep, your lips are so full, you move with grace, and I love you \nInterweaved: You sing so well (player 1), Your voice is so deep (player 2), You dance so great (1), your lips are so full (2), you act so fine (1), you move with grace (2), and I love you (together) r</item>
        <item name="IllHaveACoke">A scene is begun. At some point in the scene an onstage player has to receive a Call from Ray (or any other name agreed upon). The call can come in any form, like phone call, SMS, smoke signals, telepathy or whatever, and Ray himself may not appear in the scene. \nAs a variation, you can come up with any sentence that needs to come up. A variation would be to use I\'ll have a coke - Also known as I\'ll have a coke.</item>
        <item name="Imitate">This is an exercise for characters. 2 players will play a scene in a shop. The quality of the scene is irrelevant here, really; just get into the shop, order what you need, pay for it and off you go. Give us an object (a carrot) and we got a scene in a carrot shop. One player is designated as shopkeeper, and the other will play the customer. \nThe idea is to give the \'customer\' a basis to build a character. She will enter the shop in that character, and the other player (the shopkeeper) tries to imitate the character as closely as possible. \n \nUse the following tricks as stepping stones for building characters: \n \nAsk \'customer\' to talk to you in different voices. Pick one of these and there she goes. \nAsk the \'customer\' to pull different kinds of faces. Pick one and there she goes. \nPick a body part (elbow). There she goes; taking the suggestion \'elbow\' as inspiration for her character. \nPick an emotion and there she goes. \nAsk her to move around a bit, dance and let her freeze. The position in which she is frozen is her inspiration for the customer character. \nThis is an exercise for both players, but what is exercised is different for both: \n \nfor the customer, the exercise is building a character out of a silly suggestion. Note that there are not good or bad characters; anything in the position/suggestion given to the player can be used as inspiration, even if the \'link\' between the suggestion and the actual character is not obvious. The only goal is to come up with interesting, strong characters. \nfor the shopkeeper this is a listening/watching exercise. The idea is not for the shopkeeper to build a character based on the suggestion; it is for him to imitate as closely the character treats of the customer. \nSee also Opposite Characters.</item>
        <item name="ImproMatch">This format does not have a specific name and is mainly popular in French speaking countries. There seem to be leagues in just about every French speaking country; there\'s even a league playing this format in the Congo! These leagues meet every year to play a world championship. \n \nThe format is modeled after an ice hockey match: 2 teams of 6 players, 3 men and 3 women, perhaps with one coach per team play each other during 3 30-minute rounds, in a \'ring\' resembling an ice hockey field. The game is lead by a referee and 2 aides. \n \nThe referee draws challenges out of a bin; challenges can be mixed or separated. A mixed improv scene is played by players of both teams; a separated scene is played twice, each time by players from one team. Challenges consist of: \n \nTitle for the scene: can be anything \nNumber of players per team: can be unlimited, or specified. In some countries they may even specify the genders, like \'2 females for the red team, unlimited for the blue team\' \nCategory: might be anything, but examples would be Science Fiction, Drama, Dostojewski, Western, Musical, Opera, Without words or Without sound, or To Be Continued. For the latter one, the scene played by the first team is to be continued by the second team \nDuration: a number of minutes, ranging from 20 minutes to 30 seconds \nDuring the improvisation the referee walks though the scenes, and blows \'faults\' on a whistle. Possible faults would be: Dragging (slow play), Invalid number of players, Violation of the theme (or title), Confusion, Obstruction or Foul Play, Blocking, etc. Every fault is indicated by a particular gesture. When entering the theatre, the audience receives a \'fault card\' explaining which gesture indicates which fault. Fault can be awarded to an entire team, or to individual players. When a team collects 3 faults, the other team receives an extra point. r When a player collects 3 personal faults, he or she is expelled from the game for 5 or 10 minutes. \nEvery member of the audience also receives a slipper. This can be thrown into the ring when the audience doesn\'t like a scene, or even better, at the referee, whenever he or she makes an unpopular decision. \n \nAfter each round the team captains may ask the referee for an explanation on the faults that were blown, and then the audience gets to vote. Every team has a color, and the audience gets colored cards to vote with. \n \nAfter 3 30-minute rounds we know which team won the match. Finally, a celebrity or local hero gets to award \'stars\' to the 3 best players. \n \nThis is a very rigid format, in which just about anything, except the scenes themselves, are fixed. There is a whole protocol to be followed to play a match, and even the number of separated and mixed scenes is set in stone. The idea is that the rigidity of the format contrast well with the anything-is-possible con</item>
        <item name="InOut">Every player gets a word from the audience. When that word is said by any player, this player must leave the scene if he\'s in it, or enter the scene if he was not in it (yet). Entering and leaving the scene must be justified.</item>
        <item name="InterpretationForTheDeaf">We need 3 players for this game. One will be an expert on a topic provided by the audience; another will be the interviewer. The third will provide simultaneous interpretation for the deaf, using \'sign language\'. \nThis works best if the interview itself does not go too fast, so the interpreter has plenty of time to translate. Also helpful are returning keywords that the translator can always translate the same way. \nA gimmick is to translate everything literally, even \'dummy\' words, like \'oh\', \'great\', \'hm hm\'. \n \nWe originally listed this game under the title Translation for the Deaf - the American sign language institute pointed out to us that the correct term is indeed interpretation.</item>
        <item name="IntroducingAssociation">This little technique can be used to show a new group how natural associating really is. You can only do this with a new group, that has not played any association games before. \nPlace all players in a circle. Ask one player to say a word, no matter which one. The player to her right then says no matter what word, and so on. Do not tell them they should try and \'associate\'. \n \nYou (and hopefully the group) will notice that patterns of \'related\' or \'associated\' words emerge. Use this as an introduction to show how natural associating is to humans, and then proceed with the other association games.</item>
        <item name="Invisibility">Scene in which one of the characters in invisible to the audience. Characters act and behave as if this invisible character is visible to them. \nAs a variation, one player off-stage provides the voice for the invisible character.</item>
        <item name="Invocation">This is a kind of Opening for Long Form. It goes in three steps. \nGet a suggestion from the audience. Then this suggestion is praised by each player in turn. \nSame suggestion is praised again, but now Endowing with human attributes, naming the \'suggestion\' as humans. \nExpand the language to something. Go poetic, gibberish-french, whatever. \nAfter that, the players take on the characters that evolved during the previous rounds. \nThen, the Long Form is played using those characters.</item>
        <item name="IrishDrinkingSong">4 players sing a song about a subject, given by the audience, on an Irish-sounding tune, one line at a time. 4 lines makes 1 verse; after the frist verse, a second verse is started by player number 2; and so forth. After 4 verses every player has both started and ended a verse and the song is over. \nPlayed quite often in Who\'se Line is it Anyway. You\'ll find plenty of examples on YouTube.com. \n \nAs a variation, invent your own choreography and have the players dance as they sing. \nSee also Do Ron Ron for a similar structure.</item>
        <item name="JanusDance">This is can be used as a Trust exercise, as well as in performance. \n2 players perform a slow dance together; each with their head on the other\'s shoulder. Hence they are not looking at each other. While dancing they perform a 2â€“3 minute scene. \n \nThis gives for great listening practice, since players aren\'t looking at their partners. If is also good for overcoming (physical) awkwardness between partners that are not familiar. And it is a great exercise for physical work in the dance, as in physical expression of the character\'s feelings. \n \nAs a variation, drop the dance, and have players do a scene sitting back-to-back. In the scene the characters need not be static; they may be walking, running, performinc any activity; it\'s just the players who are sitting down. Also known as Back to Back.</item>
        <item name="JeepersPeepers">Everybody in a circle, watch the ground. On your sign, everybody lifts their head and either looks straight, left or right. Whenever 2 people look each other in the eyes, they scream as loud as they can, as if they\'re startled, and then drop dead. \nRepeat till only one or 2 players are alive. Also known as The Scream.</item>
        <item name="Jeopardy">This games is not unlike Worlds Worst : have the players close/cover their ears. Then ask the audience for questions and answers. Examples would be: \nWhat is the color of an American school bus? Yellow. \nWhat is dyslexia? Not being able to make words out of letters. \nWrite down the answers, not the question. \nThen give the players an answer and let them come up with questions that might be answered correctly by that answer. It\'s kind of like \'what would the worst/sillies/funniest question be that could have this answer?\'</item>
        <item name="Jump">This is at times a physical Warm-up, a physical association game, and a game for character work. The game is played individually but all players can do this simultaneously. \nAll players mill about the room. At any point the trainer yells Yes!, at which point all players \'jump\' into a position. Trainer can (but does not have to) sidecoach by shouting \'direction\' (see Fast Food Laban ) like \'horizontal\', \'up\', \'down\', \'sideways\', \'big\', \'small\', \'light\', \'heavy\'. \n \nThe idea then is to let the position into one has jumped inspire the player to a character, a situation. The inspiration comes from associating the position with, erm, well, whatever comes to mind. \n \nSee also Association Jump for an extension of this exercise.</item>
        <item name="JustGibberish">Excellent exercise for improv players that suffer from chronic Waffling. \nImprovise a scene, completely in gibberish, no translations provided. The scene should be perfectly clear to the audience - we should be perfectly able to translate every gibberish sentence, and the story should make sense. \n \nThis will only work if the stories are extremely simple, and if the Platform is made clear right from the start. \nSome players tend to do this as a scene without words, but that is not the idea of the exercise.</item>
        <item name="KillerBunny">This is like Bunny except that at any time, the middle bunny is allowed to lift her hands above her head, lunge to either right or left side and eat one of her own ears, after which the ear player would be out. However, any other player in the circle can prevent any ear from being chewed by yelling Die while bunny\'s arms are up in the air, in which case the middle bunny would be out.</item>
        <item name="KingGame">One player is the king or the queen. Other players are to try and pleas his/her Royal Highness. They do this by entering the room, and offering something. The queen either tells them to \ncontinue, in case she\'s interested. \ndie, in case the queen is bored \nfreeze, if the queen might be interested \nPlayers that are allowed to continue may approach the queen and the queen may unfreeze frozen players at her discretion. The game is over when a player is close enough to actually touch the queen. \nThe queen can kill a player for any reason: she may not like the message, or she may not like the way the message is presented. The queen can give hints why she does not like the offer: You know I don\'t drink coffee, so die!. The queen should be really difficult. \nAlso known as Queen Game. This is a PC document after all.</item>
        <item name="KingLizard">Everyone in a circle and picks an animal, a motion and a noise for that animal. One person sends the action to another person by making their own noise/motion, and then someone else\'s noise/motion. That person, in turn, makes their noise/motion, and then another person\'s. \nCat, monkey, and dog are commonly used, but creativity is encouraged..the sillier, the better! If someone messes up, they\'re out for that round. Last person still in is the winner.</item>
        <item name="KittyInTheCorner">Classic children\'s game. 4 to 6 players stand at corners of the playing area, one player in the middle. 2 players try to make eye contact, and then switch places, while the middle player tries to capture a corner. \nThe faster the pace, and the higher the stakes (make diagonal eye contacts!) the more fun.</item>
        <item name="KnifeBabyAngryCat">All players walk around the room. Start by one player pantomiming throwing a knife, ninja-style, to another player. That player catches the knife and throws it to another player. Players should have eye contact between thrower and catcher before the knife is thrown: it should be very clean who is supposed to catch the knife. \nOnce that goes well, add a pantomimed baby, which gets thrown very carefully. Give the baby a sound that is clearly distinguished from the knife. \n \nFinally, add in an angry cat. Again with distinct sound. \n \nFeel free to add other objects but make sure throwing style and sound are different.</item>
        <item name="Ksss">Nice warm-up, easier to play than to explain. Players in pairs. Establish a beat (by slapping your thighs). Once beat is established every player has the choice between 4 different movements: \nMove both hands up \nPoint both hands left \nPoint both hands right \nPoint both hands down \nSo, every beat goes like, slap, point, slap, point and so one. Except, when the 2 players happen to make the same movement (i.e. in the same direction) then after the next slap they both make a 5th movement: point both hands towards the other player, miming a gun, and say \'psssst\'. Next beat they do what they want again.</item>
        <item name="Kurosawa">Improvise a simple scene. Then the scene is replayed, from the point of view of one of the characters. You can replay several times, from several POVs. \n \nMake sure the scene is such that the relationships between the characters allow for clear POVs. A scene about dryly buying a pair of shoes does not lead to exciting POVs.. Also known as Rashomon. - after the movie by Akira Kurosawa, that follows different points of view as well. For the same reason: Also known as Point of View. \n \nThe technique can be used as an excellent Narration Exercise : have one improviser tell a story, something simple like what happened to him or her today, interacting with other characters. After that, other players talk about the interaction from the POV of one of the characters in the original.</item>
        <item name="LCD">This improv game is called Location, Career, Death (LCD). \nOne player on stage, the others off stage. The audience provides a location, an occupation and an object, only known to the player on stage. Second player enters and a scene is played in gibberish. Player one needs to communicate the location to player 2; as soon as player 2 thinks he\'s got it, her claps his hands and spins around. Then player 2 needs to guess the occupation; clap and spin when you think you got it. Finally, the object needs to be revealed. As soon as player 2 has the object, he needs to kill player 1 with it. \n \nThen the next player comes on stage and the game recommences, until all players have played. Afterwards, line up the players and ask them where they think they were, what their occupation was and what the murder weapon was - usually quite far off the original suggestion, much to the audience\'s amusement. \n \nAlso known as LOW. (Location, Occupation, Weapon). Also known as Chain Murder. See also Hijacker for a similar game without the Gibberish component. \n \nAs a variation, use a bell, every 10 seconds or so; at the bell players need to clap and spin and proceed to the next step, even if they are not sure about the where, who and what. Kind of LCD on speed.</item>
        <item name="LOW">This improv game is called Location, Occupation, Weapon (LOW). \nOne player on stage, the others off stage.

Kind of LCD on speed.</item>
        <item name="LaRonde">This is another Long Form improv format. The name is based on a novel by Arthur Schnitzler, called Traumnovelle, in which a series of characters sequentially bed each other, from first to last back to first. \nThe format is fairly simple: we play scenes in which at every scene switch, the \'oldest\' character disappears and a new scene is played with the remaining character, and a new one. The form ends when the circle closes and the last and first characters do a scene. Obviously, there is no need for all characters to bed each other! \n \nSwitching scenes is done by tagging out (like in Freeze Tag ). The idea is to see different aspects of a character, in different situations, interacting with different characters. \n \nFor a long discussion about the format see Chicago Improv.</item>
        <item name="LastLetter">This is an Association game, where instead of naming the first word you think of upon hearing a previous word, you name the first word you think of starting with the last letter of the previously heard word. \nAs a variation, try in combination with Walk-over Association or Word Ball.</item>
        <item name="LastLetterScene">A scene is improvised, in which every next line spoken needs to start with the last letter of the previous line.</item>
        <item name="LastLine">Get a line (any line) from the audience. Players play a scene that concludes with the given line. \nAs a variation, ask for a first line as well. Also known as First Line Last Line.</item>
        <item name="LeaveForAReason">This exercise is done without speaking. All players mill about the room, and, as a group, find a reason to leave the room. All players should leave at the same time, and the reason should be obvious to all players. \nGreat exercise to train group agreement.</item>
        <item name="LetsNot">Excellent game to train narrative skills, but a bit controversial. \nPlay in pairs: start with a location (e.g. a beach). One player give the suggestions (e.g. let\'s find a talking crab). The other player either accepts the offer, and both play accordingly, or refuses the offer. When an offer is refused the first player needs to make a better offer. \n \nThis is a bit controversial in the sense that players may object to refusing offers; after all, we teach players to accept offers. Explain that the goal of this exercise is twofold: \nteach players to drop their own ideas (see Chivalry ) and happily change course in their story \nteach players which offers are \'fun\' and which ones are not. The player accepting or refusing the offers should accept any offer that \'feels good\' or that advances the story, and only reject offers that don\'t sound like fun or don\'t seem to offer any potential for an interesting story. \nSee Ding and Yes Lets - or Rather Not for similar exercises.</item>
        <item name="LetterNumberName">Warm-up game that\'s also good to get to know each other\'s names. \nEveryone in a big circle. You start by \'giving\' your neighbor your name. Just lift your right arm and call your name to your neighbor. He does the same to his neighbor, and names run around the circle. \n \nThen do the same with the letters of the alphabet. Give an \'a\' to your neighbor, making a \'giving\' gesture with your right hand. Your neighbor continues by passing a \'b\' to his neighbor, and so on. \n \nDitto with the numbers 1 to 9. Use another gesture, e.g. pass the number by tipping your right foot in the direction of your neighbor. \n \nWhen everyone\'s got this, try all of this at the same time. Start by passing your name, and as soon as the name thing has advanced 2 or 3 players across the circle, set a letter thing in motion, and then a number thing. If you have enough players, just mix and match. \n \nPay attention to how much gets lost - does everything you set in motion eventually get back to you or not? You can coach players by saying they only need to pay attention to what their neighbor does, not what\'s going on elsewhere in the circle. \n \nAs a variation, feel free to pass other things, each with it\'s own gesture. Possibilities are: \nmonths of the year; \nnotes (like \'do\', \'re, \'mi\',..)</item>
        <item name="LineMirror">This is an extension of the Mirror game. Have all players line up in two face-to face rows, about three feet apart, holding hands (within a row). All players can slowly start moving, but keep holding hands, and all movements get mirrored by the other row. \nAs a variation, if you have enough players, form one long U-shaped row, so that the ends of the U face each other. The repeat the exercise as described above.</item>
        <item name="LittleVoice">One player plays an improvised scene. The other player(s) play the voice(s) of objects in the environment in which the first player plays. \nAnything can have a voice. Examples: \n \na player walks in a forest and an ant starts talking to him \na player is in the bathroom and his toothbrush starts talking \nAs a variation, you can script the text of the little voice, and have the player justify anything that is said. See Actor\'s Nightmare. See Evil Stick of Gum for a different variation of the same improv game. \nMake sure players immediately make clear what exactly is doing the talking. Either the voice makes this clear, or the other player: \nOh my god, a talking duck with a machine gun! \nBet you\'ve never seen a talking couch, have you? \nPlay Name the Monster in combination with this game. Also known as Speck.</item>
        <item name="Location">Get a location (say the Post Office). The whole long form is played in one and the same Post Office. Different characters wander in and out, you can even do time shifts and playbacks, but the environment of the scene is limited to the location given.</item>
        <item name="LostFriend">All players start milling about the room. You then ask them to greet each other, perhaps just by shaking hands. Players just shake hands, move on, and greet the next player they meet. Then ask the players to greet each other in a more specific way. Possibilities are: \ngreet each other like you greet a long lost friend \ngreet someone you don\'t really trust \ngreet an ex-lover \ngreet someone you really hate \nsomeone you have a secret crush on \nsomeone you had a one-night stand with \nsomeone that sold you a crappy used car \nsomeone with bad breath \ngreet someone like you are a cowboy, a soldier, a nanny, a Russian farmer,.. \nAlso known as Hello. Also known as Greetings. See also Presents.</item>
        <item name="Lotus">This is just a series of scenes in which each new scene evolves out of the dynamics of the previous scene. Divide the stage in 3 playing areas. Put at least 2 players in each area. Then in each area a scene is played. The first group starts with nothing. As soon as the second pair or group understands the dynalics of the first scene, they start theirs. Ditto with the third group or pair. \nThis is done 3 times, to yield 9 scenes. Every time a group or pair starts a new scene, the previously created characters are used again. \n \nAs a variation, start with 3 monologues.</item>
        <item name="LoungeSinger">Ask for an unlikely place to find a lounge singer. One player improvizes a solo song, Frank Sinatra style. You\'ll get something like Welcome to the pediatrician\'s Office. \nGreat opener!</item>
        <item name="Lugares">This is a Long Form format, which starts by an in-depth interview of an audience member. Audience is asked who can think of a location that has a strong emotional meaning. One suggestion is accepted and the person who offered the suggestion is taken on-scene for an interview. The goal of the interview is to describe, as precisely as possible, that location. Details are important: where are doors, pictures, cupboards. Any particular memories of what happened in that location, who with. Any secrets about that location (or stashed away in that location). \nBased on the input of the audience member, a series of scenes are played, all connected to the information given. Scenes may take place in the location described, or may simply be inspired by what was revealed in the interview. \n \nThe word lugar (lugares is plural) is Spanish for place or location. The format is attributed to Patti Styles.</item>
        <item name="Machines">MC/trainer comes up with a (real or invented) machine. The players make the machine; every player becomes a part of the machine. We want to see/hear the machine work. \nAs a variation, tell the players the machine goes into overdrive, until it explodes. Or tell the players the power\'s out, and the machine slowly grinds to a halt.</item>
        <item name="MakeMoreInteresting">Simple exercise, useful for players that are too verbal. \nOne player starts a scene. As soon as the trainer claps his hands, the player needs to make whatever he was doing more interesting, without advancing. If our player was opening a briefcase at the clap, he needs to make \'opening a briefcase\' more interesting; he is not allowed to take something out of the briefcase, as that would be advancing; player needs to stick to \'opening the briefcase\'. \n \nSimple to explain but not so easy to play. When done well you move into the clownesque. Think about Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or Mr. Bean. \nAs a variation, at a second clap, allow the player to advance the scene. Also known as Advancing and Expanding.</item>
        <item name="MakesMeThinkOf">This Long Form handle starts with one audience suggestions, based on which a scene is played. At any point in time, any player may edit the scene by saying This reminds me of.. - and a new scene is started based on what the player was reminded of. \nThis is basically a chain Association.</item>
        <item name="MakingFaces">\' A silly handle attributed to Keith Johnstone. A number of players sit, forming a line. The middle player is the Master; the others are his servants. The master is planning something (a party or whatever) and is giving his servants instructions. Whenever the master is not looking at a particular servant or servants, these try to make faces behind the master\'s back. If they are caught they are fired and replaced by another player. \nThe idea is for the servants to take really big risks; and for the master to play this very strict, showing no mercy, creating a sense of danger.</item>
        <item name="Malapropism">This game flexes your mind. Have the players walk about in the room, point to any object, and give it another name. \nYou can use this game for players that have difficulty with association: it shows that association is natural, and that it is actually difficult not to associate. See also Dissociation.</item>
        <item name="ManOverboard">This is a nice elimination warm-up. Everyone spreads out in a staggered line, like in an aerobics class. Then someone calls one of the following: \n\'Land ahoy\' - and everyone hops on one foot, doing a salute with one hand \n\'Hit the deck\' - all down on the floor in a push-up position \n\'octopus\' - make groups of 2, one person on hands and knees and someone else over him or her in the same position \n\'Man overboard\' - groups of 2, one bending back and knees and the other on the first\'s back (piggy-back style) \n\'two three four\' - all sit down and start rowing \nWhoever is last drops out. Repeat till all but one are out.</item>
        <item name="Mantra">Let the players play a short scene. Then ask them to repeat the following mantra in their head, and replay the scene \'I\'m so happy, I\'m so happy\'. In many cases, you will find that the whole scene becomes happier. \nAs a variation, try with other mantras, like \'I hate you\', and see what the effect is. \nLet players choose a mantra, and then play a scene. \nSee Mantra Introduction for more about mantras. See also Impro for Storytellers for a discussion on the use of Mantras.</item>
        <item name="MantraIntroduction">Here\'s a way to make a point about blanking one\'s mind, subconscious thinking and spontaneity. \nHave all players sit down comfortably, if they want to close their eyes they can do so. Then ask them to blank their mind, to try and think about nothing at all. Let them do this for 2 minutes or so. While they do so, make sure to walk around, to make some minor noise (blow your nose, clear your throat, walk around) - but don\'t overdo this. If you can hear cars drive by in the street, or other people in the building, or hear birds sing then you don\'t even have to make a noise. \n \nThen ask the players who managed to think about absolutely nothing at all. Ask those who say they did whether they heard the birds, the cards, you clearing your throat. If they did, weren\'t they thinking about that, then? \n \nNow ask the players to close their eyes, and to keep repeating the sound \'mihad\' in their heads. Have them do this for about 3 minutes. Then ask them again who thought about nothing but \'mihad\'. If they are honest they should all admit they thought of all kinds of stuff. \n \nThe point is that our minds just never stop working. Even if you\'re trying to concentrate on a repeating sound in your head - a Mantra - your mind will still wander. \n \nWe are all capable of thinking about several things at a time, some people can keep up to 7 lines of thought going in their minds. Who has never driven a car, being perfectly concentrated on the traffic, without thinking about work, the groceries, the kids ? \n \nYou can use this exercise to show students they never need to be afraid of a brain freeze - our brains manage to come up with so many things all the time - if you let them. \n \nMantras are used as a technique for (Transcendental and other) meditation. The idea is to keep the most active part of your consciousness busy, and at the same time let unconscious processes and lines of thought surface. This is similar to what happens in our dreams, but it has been proven (we\'ve been told) that these meditation techniques can be more relaxing or cleansing than sleep. Don\'t take our word for that, though. \n \nYou can choose any gobbledygook word for a mantra for this exercise, as long as it\'s not an existing word (don\'t use \'banana\') or strongly resembles an existing word (\'banano\' wouldn\'t do either) - that could trigger people to think about monkeys, or a jungle, or whatever. \nSee also Mantra for examples how you might use Mantras to play scenes.</item>
        <item name="MarriageCounselEndowment">One player is sent out of the room while the host gets 2 relationship problems from the audience. 2 other players play a couple with these problems, and player one is the therapist. Players need to get the therapist to figure out what the relationship problems are.</item>
        <item name="MarshmallowMania">Improvise a scene in which the audience is not supposed to laugh. Any player who provokes a laugh, gets a piece of marshmallow in his/her mouth. Players are allowed to chew, but may not swallow. \nSee also The Gerbil. \n \nAs a variation, use grapes instead of marshmallow.</item>
        <item name="MaslowsHierarchyOfNeeds">Begin with 2 players, each on a chair. In character they start to talk about what happened to them in the past. Players take turns talking. \nThen follows a series of scenes, and for every new scene location the chairs are moved. When returning to a scene location played before, return the chairs to the position they were in the original scene in that location. \n \nEnd with the 2 chairs back front stage, as in the beginning of the play. At the same time (of course) conclude the whole story. \n \nUsually played with 2 players, but more is possible. \n \nAttributed to Dan Goldstein.</item>
        <item name="Massage">Place all players in a circle. Have everyone put their hands on their right neighbor\'s shoulders and give \'em a shoulder massage. Turn directions after a minute or so. \nAs a variation, use some judgment to see what is appropriate; that will depend on the group/ the people you are working with. You can place players in pairs, and have everyone massage the other\'s temples, calves, etc.</item>
        <item name="MasterServantDisaster">2 players, one is the master, the other is the servant. The master will ask the servant for something simple. The servant always blocks the question, and explains why this should not be possible. The master always accepts this, and asks for something else (which turns out to be impossible as well). Every time the servant has to explain why this should not be possible, the situation gets worse, until the whole thing turns out to be a disaster. \nAn example: \n \nPerkins, get me a glass of brandy. \nYes sir. Oh, sir, that won\'t be possible sir, we\'re out of brandy. \nWell, get me a glas of whisky, then. \nYes sir. Ah, sir, um, we\'re out of whisky too, sir. \nOh? Well get my any kind of alcohol, then. \nAh sir, we\'re out of alcohol sir. \nPerkins, have you been drinking again? \nWell, the staff had a little party last night, sir. \nI see. Well get me a glass of water from the kitchen then. \nYes sir. Ah, sir, the water pipes are bust sir, sorry. \nWell, get me some water from the pond then. \nAh, yes, sir, uh, sorry sir, the pond is dry, sir. \nAnd so on, until it turns out that the staff had a little party, accidentily set the kitchen on fire, used the water from the pond to fight the fire, and so on. Eventually, the only room still standing is the master\'s study, the rest of the castle has burnt down and all staff are dead. And all this for a perfectly logical explanation. \n \nThe idea is for the servant to connect all elements the master brings up, into one and the same disaster. In this respect this game resembles Boris.</item>
        <item name="MegaReplay">Divide the players in 2 groups. A scene is played by the first group from a well known story, fairy tale, historic fact. This scene nis then replayed by the other group, in a different emotion, age or style. After that the first group replays as well, again in different emotion, style or age. You can repeat this several times. \nSee other replay games like Scene Replay and Replay Gibberish.</item>
        <item name="MexicanNameWave">Players in a circle. Let them do a Mexican Wave: one player lifts both arms in the air, and down again. When his arms are totally up, his right neighbour starts doing the same, so a \'wave\' of hands circles around the circle. \nWhen they\'ve got this, at the same time, pass your name around the circle, going the other way. Names are passed by pointing to your left neighbor and saying your name. \n \nConfusing, indeed!</item>
        <item name="Micetro">Pronounce as \'Maestro\'. Comparable to Gorilla Theatre, but a bit easier, and can be played with a fairly large number of players ( up to 20), and 2 directors. \nThe names of all players are on a big score board. The directors choose for every game the appropriate number of players, perhaps by fishing name tags out of a hat. The directors explain the improv game to be played, perhaps ask the audience for suggestions, direct and correct the scene. \n \nAfter each scene or game the audience decides, by cheering or applause how many points the scene should be awarded. Each player gets as many points as the scene he or she played in was awarded. \n \nOnce everyone has played in a scene, the players with the lowest score drop off, and the whole thing starts again. The directors ensure that (certainly with large groups of players) that there are more group-games at the start of the evening, and more 2-person scenes or even monologues toward the end of the evening. \n \nThis is a fun format that can be played with mixed bunches of experienced and not-so- experienced players. Since players are immediately judged, it is perfectly possible to pitch a start player after the first round. Since this system is basically somewhat unfair, and everybody knows this, no one should take elimination too personal (well, that\'s the idea anyway). \n \nFor beginners it\'s a nice format, as the directors will correct obvious blunders. And since all players in a scene get the same score, this format limits competition between players in a scene. \n \nThe (copyrighted) format is attributed to Keith Johnstone, and also described in his book Impro for Storytellers.</item>
        <item name="Millipede">Great fun but be careful not to hurt each other. Make sure there are no objects along the walls of the room. All players in a circle, linking arms. Then move the circle to one of the walls, and \'squash\' the circle, until it becomes 2 lines, one line of players with their backs to the wall, and another line in front of the first, players facing each other. \nHave this whole construction wheel along the walls of the room at high speed. Tell players to be careful and not to make fists or they might slam into someone\'s face.</item>
        <item name="MineField">One player is blindfolded, and the room is filled with obstacles (put a couple of chairs everywhere, leave all kinds of junk on the floor). The idea is that the rest of the group will lead the blindfolded player through the room, by talking. \nAlso known as Airplane. A helpful reader offered us an explanation for the name \'Airplane\': The blindfoldee (or just eyes closed) is led through a maze composed of furniture and the other actors. He is an Airplane lost in the fog being talked down by the Air Traffic Controller, who must remain in his/her Tower. Standing on a chair/rehearsal block lends visibility for the controller. The airplane also only has a limited amount of fuel left (1â€“3 minutes, whatever) to reach a safe landing (arriving at the Tower). The airplane is also allowed two brushes-limited contact with an obstacle. The third brush or a direct hit or stepping on something directly causes a crash. They may step around, over or under the obstacles. Also, the airplane can only fly forward. It can turn in any direction, however. The directions must be given from the pilot\'s point of view; a good exercise for fledgling directors. You can also destroy all the trust you\'ve built up in your class by completely clearing the deck and torturing the Pilot. Believe us, someone will suggest it. \n \nAlso known as Obstacle Course. Also known as Blind Lead. See also Fingertips for a similar exercise.</item>
        <item name="Mirror">Players per 2, facing each other. They can move (arms, legs, eyebrows) slowly, and the other player will mirror them. This is a game of give and take - no-one should be (continuously) leading. Keep movements slow. \nAs a variation, do this with the whole group: everyone in a big circle, and everybody mirrors everybody else. Also known as Group Mirror. \nSee also Line Mirror.</item>
        <item name="MirrorInCircle">All players in a circle. Make eye contact with the player immediately in front of you, or on the other side of the circle and start mirroring each other. Once the routine is established, they both start to walk to the center of the circle and stop when they are close enough to touch, still mirroring each other. All the players should reach the center of the circle at the same time. \nAs a variation, participants can mirror who ever they want to in the circle and shouldn\'t let the person they\'re mirroring guess that they are being mirrored. \n \nAlternatively, one player gets out of the room and waits outside while somebody is designated in the circle to be copied by all the other members of the circle. The player waiting outside is called back in and has to guess, by observing the circle, who is originating the movements that everyone else is copying.</item>
        <item name="MomentosDeLaVida">This is a Long Form handle, which consists of a not-connected series of scenes, each inspired by a photograph. A photograph is projected, one or more players start a scene (or a series of connected scenes) until a new photograph is projected, after which a new scene starts, inspired by the new photograph. Scenes are typically not connected to one another. \nThe term momentos de la vida is Spanish for moments out of life. As far as we know the creator is Patti Styles.</item>
        <item name="MonologueThief">Up to 15 players line up, facing the audience. Each player gets a topic from the audience to monologue about. The leftmost person starts her monologue about her topic, and at any point any other player can \'steal\' he last 3â€“4 words from the monologue, to use it to start (or continue) their own monologue. Players are encourages to talk as fast as they can so nobody can steal their words. \nContributed by Paul Sloriale.</item>
        <item name="Montage">This is just a name for the most generic form of Long Form: a Montage is just a series of scenes, connected or not.</item>
        <item name="MontageEnding">This is not a Long Form format, but a handle that can be used to end several types of Long Forms, especially ones that have different story lines, or are rather unstructured (see Free-Form Improv ). \nIt works as follows: when time is up players bring back bits and pieces of previously played scenes; the flow between recollection of one scene into recollection of another should be organic (see Organic Edit ). Take your time bringing back previous scenes, but speed up along the way. A fun way to end the montage is like in one big boom where several recalled scenes occur in parallel (don\'t worry about the audience not being able to understand what\'s being said; if built up properly they will understand what\'s going on) and end simultaneously (perhaps hinted by a Lights Edit).</item>
        <item name="MontageSongEnding">This is like the song version of a Montage Ending in a Long Form and well suited to formats that employ more than one story line. This is basically a finale song, in which elements of all story lines are recalled.</item>
        <item name="MoonRiver">This is a improv format that consists of monologues. The story is not played, but told. The players (typically 3 or 4) line up in front of the audience, Based on a single audience suggestion they all tell the same story, each as their own character in that story. \nThe play usually starts with every character introducing him or herself. The order in which characters speak is not really important, as long as they all speak. \n \nAfter the introductions, things start to happen. Every character reflects on what is happening from their own perspective, and each character adds elements to the story. \n \nKeep going (and make sure that every character keeps contributing) and r Reincorporating as long as things stay interesting. \n \nAlso known as Spoon River. Also known as Goon River. Also known as Documentary. Also known as Spork River. \n \nSee also Voices From Heaven for a short form game version which is really based on the same handle. \n \nOrigin unknown, but the story goes that the name of the format would be inspired by a book Spoon River by Edgar Lee Masters (hop on to www.outfitters.com/illinois/fulton/masters.html for more info on Spoon River). \nThis is a great way of exercising monologues! \nReferring back to the work of Masters, many groups tend to end the format with the death of (one or more of) the character(s).</item>
        <item name="MoreOrLess">This is a nice improv show format. \nAny number of players from 5 upwards. Every player takes turns presenting a scene. First player starts, asks audience suggestions if needed, and directs the scene to the extent needed. After a couple of minutes the director asks the audience: more or less. Audience yells their preference, and if More sounds loudest, scene is continued. If audience yells Less then the scene is not continued and another player presents another scene. \n \nOriginated at the Loose Moose Theatre in Calgary, Canada.</item>
        <item name="Motel">This is another variation on the classic Harold. The twist (and hence the title): all scenes happen in the same motel room. \nSuggestion can be anything, and the opening can be a free association. After the 3 first beats of 3 story lines are played. Anything goes, but the scenes all happen in the same motel room. They may happen in the same time frame (Kennedy-era for example) or they may happen in different time frames. \n \nAfter the 3 first beats, one player from each scene does a monologue, in which she reveals to the audience a secret that the other character(s) in the scene do(es) not know. Then the 3 second beats are played. \n \nBetween the second beats and third beats, the other characters in the scenes reveal their secret that the other characters are not aware of. Conclude with 3 series of third beats. \n \nThis format is attributed to Jstar Atlanta.</item>
        <item name="MotherGoose">Great Status improv exercise. All payers play geese. The idea is to establish a pecking order, that is clear to all, without talking. There should be one Mother Goose and every player should have an idea who is (right) above him or her. After lots of clucking, see if the group can line up in pecking order.</item>
        <item name="Mousetraps">Players are blindfolded and then play a scene while mousetraps are on the ground. Brutal.</item>
        <item name="MoveAndSpeak">Play a 2-player scene, in which no-one is allowed to talk unless they create a new object and a movement along with it. All created objects stay where they are, and moving a previously created object does not lead to permission to talk. \nSee Touch to Talk for a similar improv game.</item>
        <item name="MovieReview">4â€“10 players. Ask the audience for a movie title. 2 players will do an interview: one will be the reviewer. As the movie is discussed, other players play parts of the movie.</item>
        <item name="MrSoAndSo">This is an improv game that\'s more suited for rehearsal than for performance, though I can work on stage as well. Here is how it works. \nPlayers call for new characters, by giving them names that refer to character or physical traits. Things like: Ah, here comes mr. Bad Irish Accent; I think we need Mrs. Pathological Liar for this one; Dear dear, if that isn\'t Sir Eats-People. And so on. \n \nThe idea is to challenge the other players with weird and unexpected suggestions, and forcing them to come up with an extravagant character right away. In a sense this is really institutionalised Pimping. Another game in which a similar pimping is used would be Super Heroes.</item>
        <item name="MurderEndowment">This is a general handle for a ton of endowment games: \none player leaves, the audience gives an occupation, and this player need to be endowed with that occupation. Game is over once the occupation is guessed â€“ Also known as Occupation Endowment. \naudience provides a location and a murder weapon (and perhaps an occupation for the victim as well). Player that was sent out needs to guess these â€“ Also known as Murder Endowment. Attention â€“ this is not the same game as LCD. \nAudience provides 3â€“5 objects. Players try to endow the other player to use those object - Also known as Object Endowment. \n2 players. Audience provides a secret for both; players do not hear their own secret but know the secret of the other. Then they try to endow the other players with their secrets - Also known as Secrets Endowment. \nAudience provides a new brand of superhero. E.g. toothbrushwoman. Audience also provides 2 strengths and perhaps 1 weakness for this superhero. Others try to endow player one with the name, strengths and weakness of the new brand of superhero - Also known as Superhero Endowment.</item>
        <item name="MurderMystery">This is a Long Form format that can be played with a large number of players. It is inspired by the Cluedo board game. \nThe basic idea is a gathering of many characters. Audience may provide the reason for the gathering, and audience suggestions may be used to give each player a character. One character is destined to be killed; the other characters should have reasons to kill the victim; again audience suggestions may be used for that, or you let the motives evolve as the performance develops. One player is set aside to play the detective; alternatively a second player may become the detective\'s sidekick. Alternatively, the script for the gathering and a description of the characters are prepared before the show. \n \nThe format starts with the gathering, at one point lights go out and when they come up again, the victim is dead. \n \nNext, the detective(s) interview each of the characters (separately, though other characters may interfere during the questioning). Each character should make themselves suspect, at the same time of course denying every involvement in the murder. The characters may try and implicate other characters. Events discovered during the interviews may be played as flashbacks. \n \nAfter every character has been interviewed, the detective calls all characters together, Hercule Poirot style, and discusses the motives for each character. The last character discussed is tagged as the killer. \n \nThen lights go out, and the opening scene is re-played, lights go out, come up again, and we finally see the murder happening, by the designated killer, in slow motion.</item>
        <item name="MusicalFairyTale">Musical Fairy Tale requires 5â€“7 players, plus a musician. The asks the audience for a different musical style for each player, and then asks for an audience member\'s favorite childhood fairy tale. The players take turns singing the fairy tale in their individual styles. Each player moves the story forward from where the previous player left off until the story is complete.</item>
        <item name="MyFault">You need 2 plastic bottles, each with a little bit of water (not too much or they\'d be too heavy). Make sure your bottles are sturdy. or everyone will get wet. \nHave everyone walk around leisurely, and hand 2 players the bottles. The idea is to make eye contact with someone. As soon as a player has eye contact with a player with a bottle, the bottle is thrown. If at any point the bottle is dropped, both the thrower and the receiver lie down on the floor and shout \'My Fault\' as loud as possible. After than, one of them picks up the bottle and the game continues. \n \nSide coaching: tell the players to take risks, to try and make eye contact with a player at the other side of the room. \n \nAs a variation, tell the players the bottle is red hot, and they need to throw it as fast as possible, or they\'ll burn their hand. \nThe bottle becomes extremely light, or extremely heavy, and the players act accordingly.</item>
        <item name="MysteryWord">This is a great exercise for listening skills and co-operation. A number of players (2,3,4) describe an unknown object. They all describe the same object, but they don\'t know what it is. Each player, one at a time, offers a descriptive (a non-noun describing the object). Continue until it is obvious what the object is (or until the players get stuck). Example: Green, sweet, vegetable, round: sweet peas. Counter-example: large, blue, red, small: we\'re not going to get anywhere.</item>
        <item name="Name6Circle">You will need a tennis ball or a towel tied in a knot for this one. Everyone sitting or standing in a circle. You give one person the ball, and ask him to name at least 6 (or any other number, depending on the size of the circle), in the time it takes for the ball to get passed along the circle. Things to ask for might be \nsour tasting fruit \nforeign makes of cars \nnames of seas \nB-movies \nItalian foods \nAs a variation, have one person in the middle of the circle. This person provides the category, and indicates how many replies are expected from a player in the circle. If that player does not live up to the challenge, he takes the place in the middle of the circle. \nTell players not to watch the ball go round when they\'re \'it\' - they\'ll just panic and freeze. Try this with closed eyes. \nDon\'t ask for 1940\'s Nobel Prize winners, or simply \'emotions\'.</item>
        <item name="NameGame">Perfect game to learn each other\'s names. \nEveryone in a circle. One person (A) starts by calling another person\'s name (B). At that point, A starts walking towards B. Before A gets to B, B needs to call another name Â©, so B frees her spot in the circle, for A to take. C then needs to call yet another name and start walking, so B can take C\'s spot. \n \nAs a variation, instead of calling names, players can pick another player by making eye contact (and nodding to acknowledge that eye contact has been made). This demands a lot of concentration. \nYou can have more than one cycle going, if the group is big enough. Also known as Cross Circle. Also known as Shriner\'s Warm-up.</item>
        <item name="NameVolley">Divide the class into 2 groups, maximum 6 players per group. We are going to play a mimed game of volleyball, in which every player, as they pass a ball, shouts the name of another player, who then needs to catch and pass the ball. \nWe want to be able to \'see\' the ball at any point in time.</item>
        <item name="NameTheMonster">Play in pairs, one word at a time (see Word at a Time Scene ). Choose a location (e.g. walk in the forest). Players must meet a monster, give it a name, and run away from it. \nThe \'monster\' can be anything: an evil witch, a dragon, a frog with a machine gun, a smelly French cheese, anything. \n \nAs a variation, take this game a bit further, and ask the players not to run away from the monster, but do something. Fight it, beat it, get eaten (and continue in the monster\'s stomach or in heaven/hell), make friends with it, tame it, capture it, ride it, whatever. \nThe real goal of the exercise is to get used to explicitly naming the problem (the \'monster\' in this case). \nUse this game e.g. in combination with Little Voice, to teach players to actually name whatever is talking to them.</item>
        <item name="NarrativeColorEmotion">One players tells a story, solo. 3 other players tag the player if they want to hear more action (narrative), more emotion or more color. By color we mean environmental detail, as in how does it smell, temperature, weather, colors, sounds. \nAlso known as ACE. - for Action, Color, Emotion.</item>
        <item name="Narrator">This improv format is like Typewriter without the typewriter: players improvise a scene, which a narrator describes and comments upon. Also known as Attenborough. - after the way sir Richard Attenborough did his famous nature programmes.</item>
        <item name="Nightmare">Usually known as Day in the Life. The MC picks a member of the audience and interviews this person about their average (work) day. Questions asked may include \'What is your job?, Where do you live, with who?, What are your hobbies?, How do you get to work?, Who are your colleagues?, and more. The players then improvise a day in the life of this audience member, based on the elements provided by the interview.\n\nSee also Ding Dong.\n\n\n\nAs a variation, instead of playing a real day, play a nightmare - Also known as Nightmare. Host can ask what the audience member is afraid of or does not like.</item>
        <item name="NoDoubles110">Everyone in a circle. We will count from 1 to 10. Any player can start by saying \'1\'. Then any other player can say \'2\' and so one. If 2 players say a number at the same time we start all over again. Also known as Digits.</item>
        <item name="NoP">Players play a scene (perhaps based on an audience suggestion) but they cannot use the letter \'P\' (or any other letter). When a player uses a \'P\', the audience screams \'Die\' and the player is replaced by another on. The scene continues, and the new player needs to take over the character of the player he replaces.</item>
        <item name="NonSequitur">Place players in pairs, let them hold a casual conversation about their work, the weather, anything. There will be 4 signals (hand clap or blow a whistle): \nFirst signal: keep the conversation going, but behave strange, make bizarre gestures and jerky body movements \nsecond signal: keep the strange movements going, and continue the conversation in gibberish \nthird signal: keep calm, but continue the conversation in gibberish \nforth signal: stay calm and talk normal</item>
        <item name="NuclearBombChicken">You can do this only once with a new group. Tell them they are all chickens in a henhouse, and a nuclear bomb is about to drop on the henhouse within 30 seconds, Ask the players to play the chickens as truthfully as possible, then give them the start signal. Any chicken that shows acknowledgement of the incoming bomb, fails the exercise. Chickens have no clue what a bomb is. \nThe goal of the exercise is to show the difference between the reality of the player and the reality of the character. \n \nAttributed to Stella Adler (the only known American to study directly with Russian Master Konstantine Stanislavsky). The story goes that Marlon Brando got it and simply went about laying an egg while the other chickens went in a frenzy.</item>
        <item name="ObjectEndowment">This is a general handle for a ton of endowment games: \none player leaves, the audience gives an occupation, and this player need to be endowed with that occupation. Game is over once the occupation is guessed â€“ Also known as Occupation Endowment. \naudience provides a location and a murder weapon (and perhaps an occupation for the victim as well). Player that was sent out needs to guess these â€“ Also known as Murder Endowment. Attention â€“ this is not the same game as LCD. \nAudience provides 3â€“5 objects. Players try to endow the other player to use those object - Also known as Object Endowment. \n2 players. Audience provides a secret for both; players do not hear their own secret but know the secret of the other. Then they try to endow the other players with their secrets - Also known as Secrets Endowment. \nAudience provides a new brand of superhero. E.g. toothbrushwoman. Audience also provides 2 strengths and perhaps 1 weakness for this superhero. Others try to endow player one with the name, strengths and weakness of the new brand of superhero - Also known as Superhero Endowment.</item>
        <item name="ObjectMorphing">Good exercise on object work: players in pairs. First player builds an object, as precise and careful as possible, then hands it over to the other. Second player accepts the object, being as truthfull to what the first player built as possible. After having acknowledged this, player 2 starts morphing the object into something else. This can be done by bending, breaking, twisting, extending, shrinking, you name it. When the new object is complete it gets passed back to player 1, who accepts and then morphs it. \nAs a variation, you can do this in a circle, passing and morphing objects around the circle.</item>
        <item name="ObjectNarrative">Place one chair on stage. The group sits or stands to the sides so they can see what is going on. Someone chooses an object from the room and places it on the chair. (Or get an object from the audience in a show) That object is your suggestion. \nOne at a time, three members (or how ever many you decide) do a short monologue off that object. One person starts and when they are done, they leave the object on the chair for the next person. Whoever is inspired jumps up next adding their part of the story/situation from another character\'s point of view. and the third person completes the cycle. \n \nThis exercise is extremely character based. The first character sets the story in motion and then the other two people find a way to be another interesting character that will accept and heighten the first initiation. The challenge is to not be totally predictable with the follow up character choices (avoid immediately choosing to be the spouse when you could be that person\'s mailman..or manicurist instead). At the same time you still want to support the story line and justify what the previous characters have already established. The characters don\'t have to know each other, but they must have connections (if only through the object). \n \nThis exercise helps: \n \nlistening (you must listen to the characters before you to know how you can fit into the story/situation and justify it.) \ncharacter work \nTruthfulness (try not to focus \'just\' on the object. It\'s about the relationships and connections between the 3 different characters.) \nReincorporating</item>
        <item name="Objects">Divide the class in 2 groups. Give one group the name of an object, and they become, as a group, the object. Other group guesses.</item>
        <item name="ObstacleCourse">One player is blindfolded, and the room is filled with obstacles (put a couple of chairs everywhere, leave all kinds of junk on the floor). The idea is that the rest of the group will lead the blindfolded player through the room, by talking. \nAlso known as Airplane. A helpful reader offered us an explanation for the name \'Airplane\': The blindfoldee (or just eyes closed) is led through a maze composed of furniture and the other actors. He is an Airplane lost in the fog being talked down by the Air Traffic Controller, who must remain in his/her Tower. Standing on a chair/rehearsal block lends visibility for the controller. The airplane also only has a limited amount of fuel left (1â€“3 minutes, whatever) to reach a safe landing (arriving at the Tower). The airplane is also allowed two brushes-limited contact with an obstacle. The third brush or a direct hit or stepping on something directly causes a crash. They may step around, over or under the obstacles. Also, the airplane can only fly forward. It can turn in any direction, however. The directions must be given from the pilot\'s point of view; a good exercise for fledgling directors. You can also destroy all the trust you\'ve built up in your class by completely clearing the deck and torturing the Pilot. Believe us, someone will suggest it. \n \nAlso known as Blind Lead. Also known as Mine Field. See also Fingertips for a similar exercise.</item>
        <item name="OccupationEndowment">This is a general handle for a ton of endowment games: \none player leaves, the audience gives an occupation, and this player need to be endowed with that occupation. Game is over once the occupation is guessed â€“ Also known as Occupation Endowment. \naudience provides a location and a murder weapon (and perhaps an occupation for the victim as well). Player that was sent out needs to guess these â€“ Also known as Murder Endowment. Attention â€“ this is not the same game as LCD. \nAudience provides 3â€“5 objects. Players try to endow the other player to use those object - Also known as Object Endowment. \n2 players. Audience provides a secret for both; players do not hear their own secret but know the secret of the other. Then they try to endow the other players with their secrets - Also known as Secrets Endowment. \nAudience provides a new brand of superhero. E.g. toothbrushwoman. Audience also provides 2 strengths and perhaps 1 weakness for this superhero. Others try to endow player one with the name, strengths and weakness of the new brand of superhero - Also known as Superhero Endowment.</item>
        <item name="OldJobNewJob">Improvise a scene with 2 players, and give them a job (or let the audience provide the job). Then tell them what job they had in a previous life. \nThe idea is that somehow in the scene characters reflect their previous jobs in their actual life. The idea is not to \'play\' the old job, but to show character traits of someone with the old job while performing the new job (are we making sense here?)</item>
        <item name="OneDuck">Everyone in a circle. We are going to say a pattern, one word per player, going clockwise. It goes like: \nOne Duck, two Legs, Quack \nTwo Ducks, four legs, Quack Quack \nThree Ducks, six legs, Quack Quack Quack \nAnd so on, till someone misses. \nAs a variation, try with an insect instead of a duck (6 legs per insect), or a spider (eight legs) and invent a sound the insect might make.</item>
        <item name="OneEightyFive">Not really improv theater but done by a quite a few troupes, and fun when done well. Get a term, e.g. \'Elephants\'. The lines go like \n185 elephants walk into a bar \nThe bartender says Sorry but we don\'t serve elephants here \n(witty line that\'s the reply of the elephants ) \nPlayers basically come up with an instant joke about 185 whatevers that enter the bar. As we said, not really theater..</item>
        <item name="OneLineScene">Play a one or two minute scene, where only one line of dialog can be spoken. Indicate to the players when they have, say, 20 seconds left. \nThis exercise teaches players what can be communicated using non-verbal communication. Things like, \'thank you\', \'I love you\', \'I appreciate this\', \'I\'m sorry and so forth can all be communicated non-verbally.</item>
        <item name="OneMouth">One player (or the MC) is going to interview all other players, but the group of other players are really one character. This character answers the questions, but all players provide the answer at the same time, as if the character is speaking out of many mouths simultaneously. The answers should make sense (at least grammatically) and should be clear. If one player starts answering a question by saying \'YYYY\' no-one should try and turn that into a \'No\'. \nworks best if everyone goes for the obvious and simple answers. \ndon\'t try to speak too fast, but take your time to let the answer organically grow. \ncoach players to take the lead if the answers is sagging, and to happily give up the lead as soon as they feel they got the lead. \nmove players that stubbornly always take the lead to another position in the group (at the back or at the ends). \nAs a variation, you can try and use this as an audience warm-up, and try to get the audience to talk to the MC out of one mouth. This is suggested in Impro for Storytellers.</item>
        <item name="OneTwoThreeFour">Okay, this is harder to explain than it is to play. This game is a repetition of 4 movements: \n1 : touch your head with both hands \n2 : touch your shoulders with both hands \n3 : touch your hips with both hands \n4 : slap right foot with right hand \nWe repeat this 10 times, as follows: \n \njust say 1,2,3,4 - no movements, do this twice \ntouch your head (on \'1\' but don\'t say \'1\') and say 2,3,4. Repeat twice. \ntouch head (on \'1\') touch shoulders (on \'2\', but don\'t say \'1\' or \'2\'). Follow by 3,4, spoken. Repeat twice \ntouch head, touch shoulders, touch hips (on the rhythm on 1,2,3, but don\'t say 1,2,3). Say \'4\'. Repeat twice \ntouch head, shoulders, hips, slap foot. Don\'t say anything but stay in the rhythm and repeat twice \nThen just start all over again by saying 1,2,3,4 twice. \n \nIncrease tempo as you go along.</item>
        <item name="OnlyQuestions">A scene is improvised, in which any sentence used by the players must be a question. Players that use statements instead of questions are boo-ed out by the audience (audience yells \'Die\') and are replaced by other players. New players need to take over the character of the players they replace. \nAlthough questions are quite often frowned upon in improv (see Questions and Wimping ), in this game the idea is to build a story. That implies that any question should be giving information, and should be (implicitly) advancing on the information already available. Evidently, the next player should implicitly accept any information that was given in the previous question(s).</item>
        <item name="OpenOffer">One player starts a scene by making an offer that is not \'complete\', in the sense that it is vague enough not to define the who/what/where right away. Another player steps in and completes the Platform. \nAlthough in performance we probably want to establish our Platform as early as possible, this game teaches improv players how to quickly build platforms as a group or a team.</item>
        <item name="OpenYourHand">Let the players walk around the room leisurely. Then ask them to stop, open their hands, and let something fall out of the sky, right into their hands. Let them name the object in their hands, set it aside, move on and open their hands again. \nSome people find this a bit of a scary game, as if they are afraid they are not going to come up with anything. Explain that there are no wrong answers. \nSome players will complain that everything that falls out of the sky is a dead bird (or whatever). Explain to them that this is fine too. Most players, if reassured that they really can\'t go wrong, move on to other stuff after 10 dead birds or so. \n \nAs a variation, you can tell players they can vary the way they extend their hands or hand. They can hold hands in front of them, above their head or close to the ground. See if different stuff shows up. \nA slightly less difficult version of this game can be done by having players put their hands in their pockets and take something out. Make sure they all got pockets if you want to play this game. This version is slightly easier, as anything in their pockets, like dust, or the way the fabric feels, can trigger and idea; when holding your hands out there is very little to trigger an idea. \n \nKeith Johnstone describes similar games in his book Impro.</item>
        <item name="OppositeCharacters">This is basically the opposite to Imitate : for the shopkeeper, rather than imitating the customer\'s character, try and build a totally opposite character. \nAs a side coaching, point players to the following character treats: \n \nvoice (loud/soft/harsh ? intonation?) \nStatus (high/low?) \nAge? Occupation? \nWay the body moves? (take a look at Fast Food Laban for more on movement) \nNote that this is also a looking/listening exercise for the shopkeeper!</item>
        <item name="Opposites">Let the players walk around the room in silence. Ask them how they would classify themselves: \nhigh or low Status \nloud or silent \ncaring or careless \nstrong or weak \ntall or small \nsecure or insecure \nclumsy or perfect \nhappy or sad \nintrovert or extravert \nbasically anything that would be a character trait \nThen ask them to imagine they are exactly the opposite of all these character traits. Ask them to move about like such a character. Then play scenes in which the players \'become\' the opposites of their own characters.</item>
        <item name="Oracle">3 players all together are an Oracle who answers questions chosen by the audience using one word at a time. Each player says one word and lets the next players give the next word in the reply. \nSee Word at a Time Expert.</item>
        <item name="OtherChoice">A scene is played. Whenever the MC ring a bell (or yells \'Ding\'), the player that is doing something/saying something needs to say/do something else. \nDoing \'something else\' is quite often interpreted as doing/saying the opposite of what you did before. One can be more creative, e.g. repeat what was said in a different emotion. \nIf you use this as an exercise on Spontaneity the trainer can \'Ding\' quite often (very frustrating for the players, but they will come up with stuff they never would have thought of before). Disadvantage of this is that the story/characters tend to get lost. Use sparingly for performance. Also known as Ding.</item>
        <item name="Overload">Excellent exercise to train listening skills by means of sensory overload. 4 players. One plays and stands centrally. This player has to: \nanswer simple arithmetic questions posed by left player \nanswer simple personal questions posed by right player \nmirror the movements made by the player in front of her \nIf the central player misses something, or fail to answer a question, the player who is not followed keeps saying \'Beep beep beep\' until the question is answered or the movement is mirrored. \nRotate players after a few minutes so everyone gets their turn.</item>
        <item name="PanLeftPanRight">4 players in a square; 2 in front, 2 behind them. The MC or host asks for an audience suggestion for the 2 players in front. Then the host asks the players to turn the square (to the right or to the left). So now we have a different combination of players in front. These 2 get an audience suggestion. Turn again and ask for suggestion again and do this once more. Then have players take their original position. \nThe game is played as follows: the 2 players in front start improvising a scene; the 2 players in the back move to the side to clear the stage. Players play until the host yells Call, at which time all players step back to their original positions in the square. MC then calls Right or Left, and square turns accordingly. The 2 players in front start playing a scene based on their suggestion until MC calls again. \n \nThis is repeated. When 2 players are up front for the second or third time, they continue their previously played scene. They can either plainly continue it, or continue at some time in the future (a day later, a year later, a century later). Also known as Revolver. Also known as Diamond. Also known as Turntable.</item>
        <item name="PaperclipGame">This is a great improv exercise for teaching players to recognize patterns and heighten what has been established. \nEveryone forms a backline. One person steps forward and says what object he is and what his function is, like I\'m a paperclip, and I hold loose papers together. A second person steps up and says what object he is, and what his similar function is, like I am a rubber band and I hold loose pieces of mail together. At that point a pattern is established and everyone just steps forward one-by-one and heightens the pattern: \n \nI am twine and I hold loose recyclable newspapers together. \nI am shackles and I hold loose chain gang prisoners together. \nI am religion and I hold loose communities together. \nRepeat until it\'s as heightened as it\'s going to get, then start over again with a new object and function.</item>
        <item name="ParallelUniverse">This is an interesting improv handle: the audience provides 2 different environments/locations. Then 2 pairs of players play 2 improvised scenes, one in each environment, but the scenes are played at the same time (on the same scene, of course). Players do not acknowledge characters or events that do not happen in their scene. \nBe careful to allow both pairs for \'scene time\'.</item>
        <item name="PartyQuirks">One player plays a character that is having a party. The other players will be the guests, and the audience provides us with what quirks the guests might have. Of course the host does not know what quirks the guests have. His task is to guess who the guests might be, based on hints the guests offer. \nThe games is over as soon as the host has guessed all guests. \n \nAs a variation, use characters instead of quirks - Also known as The Party.</item>
        <item name="PassBall">All players in a circle. Ask the players to pass a mimed ball to others (one ball at a time). Then side-coach: the ball becomes heavier, until it weighs a ton, or extremely light, extremely big (and light or heavy) or extremely small (and light or heavy). \nWe need to \'see\' the ball\'s characteristics in the way it gets passed.</item>
        <item name="PassCatch">Everybody in a big circle. One player starts the game by making a gesture and a sound to his right neighbor. The neighbor immediately imitates gesture and sound, then turns to his right neighbor and makes a totally different gesture and sound. \nTell players not to preconceive, ask them to throw themselves into this exercise. \n \nAs a variation, instead of passing the sound/gesture to your neighbor, players can pass it to any player in the circle. \nTry the game without imitating the sound/gesture received; just have players turn around and throw a new gesture/sound to their neighbors as fast as possible. \nAlso known as Sound Circle.</item>
        <item name="PassClap">Classic warm-up. Everyone in a circle. One player starts by throwing a hand clap to her right neighbor, and the neighbor passes the clap to his right neighbor. \nPlay this till the clap really flows nicely around the circle. Then tell the group that players may decide to pass the clap back to the neighbor they got it from. Try it and notice how disruptive this can be. \n \nAs a variation, try these for variation: \nwhen receiving a clap, first clap back to the sender, then turn to your neighbor to pass it on; \npass claps either high (bending down) or high (above your head) \ncombine both of the above. \nTry clapping twice, three times or 4 times when you pass the clap. Make movement doing that (like clap 4 times, low to high as you pass the clap) \nTry clapping (simultaneously) in pairs, 3 or even 4 players at a time. \nSee also Synchro Clap. See also Pass Yes.</item>
        <item name="PassYes">This is a bit like Pass Clap and all it\'s variations. One player starts by saying \'Yes\' to her lefthand neighbor. Neighbor does the same, passing the \'Yes\' to her lefthand neighbor. Or she decides to say \'No\', after which it\'s her right-hand neighbors turn. \nTry and pass the \'Yes\' along the circle as fast as possible. \n \nWhen everyone\'s got this. Do the same but with eyes closed.</item>
        <item name="Patterns">This is a bit like Free Association Circle, except that player are not to freely associate on the previously heard word, but on the ensemble of what has been heard, thereby heightening is. Example: grass, plant, flower, tree, forest, jungle. Restart as soon as you can heighten any more.</item>
        <item name="Pauze">Great exercise to teach improvisers to listen. This is basically a 2 player dialog. Every player needs to wait 5 seconds before replying. The idea is that this forces the improvisers into really considering what was said to them, how it was said and why it was said.</item>
        <item name="PeckingOrder">Every player picks a number between 1 and the number of players in the scene. Numbers are kept secret, so doubles are possible and allowed. Then a scene is played in which each player tries to play the status picked; 1 being the highest status. Obviously they don\'t know which numbers the others picked, so each player will have to choose how to position his or her status with respect to each other player, and this choice can be wrong. \nMost fun if several players pick highest or lowest status.</item>
        <item name="PeruvianBallGame">Everyone starts milling about the room, miming a particular kind of ball. It can be light or heavy, have a texture, whatever, as long as it is particular. At the trainer\'s sign, everyone passes their ball to someone else. This is done a couple of times, after which everyone tries to find back his or her ball. \nDescribed in Augusto Boal \'s Games for Actors and Non-actors.</item>
        <item name="Pillars">Put one member of the audience on stage (the pillar). A scene is played, but each player can at any point stop his sentence and ask the Pillar to provide the next word.</item>
        <item name="PingPong">This is like Word at a Time Expert, but with a bit more scene work. 2 players, speaking one word at a time, alternating between the players. The scene is starting by stating who they are, or where they are. Example: We-are-on-a-sunny-beach. The players then actually play that, and build a story, word at a time, and actually playing the story at the same time. \nFor example: We-see-a-dead-whale; the players should actually see the whale, and do something with it. There is no need to \'say\' everything before doing it ( use our motto: Play it, don\'t say it). \nAllow a third character to enter the scene, playing against the two others. Now the lines are done word per word, by 3 players, but we have 2 characters. This gets extremely silly/messy - to create some order out of this chaos make sure the third player (i.e. the second character) has a different voice (different accent or pitch). Unlikely to produce interesting stories, but quite hilarious. Also known as Word at a Time Scene, if there is no third player. \n \nPlayers have an adventure together; the story needs to happen to both of them, they are not to play against each other. \nAs many players tend to verbosity, use a director that \'cuts\' the scene and tells the players what to do. Example: Give the whale mouth-to-mouth.</item>
        <item name="Pivot">Tell the players to imagine the stage is a disc, only supported right in the center of the stage. We are going to play a scene, in which the disc needs to be balanced at all times. Anytime a player moves, or a new player enters, the others need to rebalance the disc, and every move needs to be justified. \nAlso known as Disc(1). There is another version of this game - see Disc(2).</item>
        <item name="PlayTag">Just play tag. Excellent physical warm-up. Tell players to take risks, see how close you can get/stay to the tagger without being caught. \nSee SloMo Tag for an exercise to follow this one.</item>
        <item name="Playbook">This one is played by 2 players, one of which gets their lines on paper (like a script). The other player should justify whatever the scripted player says. \nYou can use existing plays for this, but also lines from comics. \nWhoever gets the script should not forget to play/act - only her lines are defined, not what she does, or how she does the lines. \n \nAlso known as Actor\'s Nightmare. See Don\'t Mess with Textus for a similar handle.</item>
        <item name="Pockets">Before the show, ask the audience to write simple sentences on slips of paper. Anything goes. \nThe game is played by 2 players. Ask for a location, or a profession, and have every player draw 3 of these slips. Players put these in their pockets without reading them. \n \nThen a scene is played, in which at any point in time, players replace what they might have said, by whatever is on the piece of paper they draw out of their pocket. Try to incorporate/justify whatever is your line into the scene. \n \nTry to avoid thinks like \'My granny always said\' - you want your character to say whatever is on the piece of paper - don\'t try to put those words into someone else\'s mouth. See also a game called Bucket that uses audience lines as well.</item>
        <item name="PoetTranslator">A simple translation game. The setup is a foreign language poet, who performs some of his work in Gibberish. The translator translates. Nice is number of lines, metrum, and rhymes are kept.</item>
        <item name="PoetryCorner">You may want to practice this one: 1 player starts with the first line of a poem; player 2 adds second line, and so forth. \nTry different formats: limericks, sonnets, haikus etc..</item>
        <item name="PointOfView">Improvise a simple scene. Then the scene is replayed, from the point of view of one of the characters. You can replay several times, from several POVs. \n \nMake sure the scene is such that the relationships between the characters allow for clear POVs. A scene about dryly buying a pair of shoes does not lead to exciting POVs.. Also known as Rashomon. - after the movie by Akira Kurosawa, that follows different points of view as well. For the same reason: Also known as Kurosawa. \n \nThe technique can be used as an excellent Narration Exercise : have one improviser tell a story, something simple like what happened to him or her today, interacting with other characters. After that, other players talk about the interaction from the POV of one of the characters in the original.</item>
        <item name="PoisonArms">Tell the players they are Samurai, and their right forearm is a poisoned sword. Then have them do a slow motion sword fight. \nThe only way to fend off a \'sword\' is by blocking it with your right arm. If another player\'s sword touches your body on any other part than your right forearm, you die a gruesome death (also in slow motion). \n \nPlayers should not speed up when they are about to get \'killed\', but rather \'let themselves be killed\'. Good game to teach a little Chivalry. \nAlso known as SloMo Samurai.</item>
        <item name="Popcorn">Everyone finds themselves a nice spot, and squat down. The teacher now talks the group through this exercise. Everyone is a piece of corn, the floor is a big pan, and we\'re going to make popcorn. We slowly start heating the pan; as the pan gets hotter, corn starts to \'pop\'. A player can \'pop\' by jumping up, clapping hands above their head, and saying \'pop\'. \nMake sure the \'popping\' starts gradually, \'popping\' is a group thing, and in the end, \'popping\' should stop. \n \nAs a variation, forget to take the pan off the fireplace, and have the popcorn start charring.</item>
        <item name="PopupStorybook">On stage actors pop up from a lying position as a narrator tells the story, or introduces the next scene. The narrator may pull the tab or turn the wheel to put some action in the page. Justification should be placed on both the narrator and the pop-up actors at various times throughout the story. \n \nYou can either have the whole story told by the narrator, or use the flip-of-the-page as your Edit mechanism. In the latter case, once the whole scene has popped-up, a player may start playing, talking, walking around. \n \nAs a variation, remember that players may as well pop up as props; this may be a good way to do some Object Work.</item>
        <item name="Presents">Great warm-up exercise that helps you blank your mind. Good for control freaks. \nPlayers stand in pairs and give each other presents. To give a present, you just open your arms/hands to indicate you\'re holding something. Don\'t try to think about what you\'re holding, but give it to your companion. \n \nUpon receiving the present, you give it a name, the first thing that comes to mind. You say something like \'Oh, thanks, a little dead bird\'. You promptly ignore your present and return something else to your companion. \n \nThis game works best if it\'s played fast, so players really don\'t have the time to preconceive. It\'s also nice and positive, as everybody is always extremely happy with their presents, no matter what they are. n \n \nIf players complain they always receive the same present (It\'s always a book) tell them this is quite okay - they should be happy to receive so many books. See also Spontaneity for related games.</item>
        <item name="PressConference">This is a verbal improv game, played with 3 to 8 players. One player leaves the room, while the audience provides the name of a famous or historical person. The \'absent\' player will give a press conference, but he does not know who he is. The other players are journalists, whose questions should provide indications to who the mystery guest might be. \nGame ends when our player guesses who he is. \n \nThe \'journalists\' should really play journalist characters. They can take photographs, or have a fight about who gets to ask the next question. \nAs a variation, instead of a famous or historical person, choose an expert. The game is over when the \'expert\' figures out what he or she is expert in.</item>
        <item name="PrimalScreams">All players in a circle. On player steps into the circle, making a big gesture and a loud sound. Player then steps back, and the rest of the circle imitates the sound and gesture. \nTry and do this with open sounds, as loud as possible. As Keith Johnstone says: Yelling \'en masse\' is good for the soul.</item>
        <item name="Props">In this game the players need to come up with an original/funny use of a prop. They cannot use the prop the way it is supposed to be used for, obviously. \nYou could really use any object as if it were a cell phone, but that is not the idea of the exercise. Look at the object (or it\'s parts) and see what inspires you. We once saw a player, given a chair, who turned into a prisoner. The back of the chair became the bars of this cell.</item>
        <item name="ProtestSong">Ask the audience for something that pisses them off. Then improvise a song about it, like the 70s screw-the-government type characters. Typically done as a Verse-Chorus type song.</item>
        <item name="Puppets">4 players. 2 players will be puppets; these players offer the lines of dialog in the scene, but they are not allowed to move about themselves. The other 2 players are the puppet masters, that will provide the movements for the puppets. \nAs a variation, some groups use audience members to play the puppets or the puppet masters.</item>
        <item name="QueenGame">One player is the king or the queen. Other players are to try and pleas his/her Royal Highness. They do this by entering the room, and offering something. The queen either tells them to \ncontinue, in case she\'s interested. \ndie, in case the queen is bored \nfreeze, if the queen might be interested \nPlayers that are allowed to continue may approach the queen and the queen may unfreeze frozen players at her discretion. The game is over when a player is close enough to actually touch the queen. \nThe queen can kill a player for any reason: she may not like the message, or she may not like the way the message is presented. The queen can give hints why she does not like the offer: You know I don\'t drink coffee, so die!. The queen should be really difficult. \nAlso known as King Game. This is a PC document after all.</item>
        <item name="Radiophonics">This Long Form handle is basically a series of scenes, connected by music. The music can be provides by a live player or band, or by a DJ. The show starts with a piece of (preferably well known) song as inspiration for the scene. The music is *in* the scene, and is not just underscoring. Say e.g. The Girl From Ipanema is being played. This might inspire the players to start a scene in an elevator. As long as they are in the elevator, the music plays (or as long as no player finds a reason for the music to stop, like e.g. an electricity outage). \nTo edit, and go to a new scene, a new song is needed. It can be initiated by the musician/DJ, or by a player, who may e.g. turn on the radio. As the (new) song plays, the scene fades away and a new scene starts, again inspired by the song. And the music is really in the scene until a player finds a way to stop or mute it, or leave the location where the music is. \n \nThis format was developed by the French improv theatre La Carpe Haute from Strasbourg.</item>
        <item name="Rash">Make sure you have as many pieces of paper as there are players. Write \'cure\' on all but one, and a disease (like \'rash\') on one. Each player draws a piece of paper, but no-one knows who\'s got the disease. Then find the disease and cure it. \nAs a variation, have one \'cure\' and all the others the same disease.</item>
        <item name="Rashomon">Improvise a simple scene. Then the scene is replayed, from the point of view of one of the characters. You can replay several times, from several POVs. \n \nMake sure the scene is such that the relationships between the characters allow for clear POVs. A scene about dryly buying a pair of shoes does not lead to exciting POVs.. Known as Rashomon - after the movie by Akira Kurosawa, that follows different points of view as well. For the same reason: Also known as Kurosawa or Point of View. \n \nThe technique can be used as an excellent Narration Exercise : have one improviser tell a story, something simple like what happened to him or her today, interacting with other characters. After that, other players talk about the interaction from the POV of one of the characters in the original.</item>
        <item name="RealEstateBroker">One player is a real estate broker and shows a second player (or multiple players) around a space, given by the audience/trainer. Each player can create whatever they wish in the space, and questions are not allowed. Any object created should be justified (by the broker or by the others). And obviously any object created stays where it is (unless explicitly moved).</item>
        <item name="RebelWithoutAClue">Excellent improv game to train listening skills. \n4 players, one leaves the room. Pick a means of transportation, and an object. The idea is that player number 4 needs to guess the means of transportation, and then use the object to hijack the others. Finally pick a goal for the hijacker to achieve. \n \nThe players need to provide hints to the hijacker, but they cannot explicitly tell the hijacker what to do, with what or why. Also known as Hijacker. \n \nWorks best is players take risks. If they to the \'wrong\' thing or use the wrong object the audience will probably just laugh, and that should be enough to signal the player he\'s going the wrong way.</item>
        <item name="ReceiverRightClap">Nice concentration and warmup exercise. All players in a circle. Players can throw a \'clap\' to any other player by pushing their hands together in front of their chest (like a praying gesture), and then pushing both hands towards the receiving player, opening up their arms as they do so. Sending a \'clap\' makes a \'Whoof\' sound; receiving a clap makes a sucking sound. \nThe receiver receives the clap by making the inverse gesture, and uttering a sucking sound. \n \nOnce a clap is received, the player to the right of the receiver sends a new clap to any other player. And so one. \n \nOnce everyone\'s got it, switch to left-hand side player of the receiver to send the next clap. \n \nAs a variation, if all players are really concentrating, and this game goes particularly well, try \'skipping\' a neighbor. E.g. the second player to the left of the receiver sends the next clap.</item>
        <item name="RemoteControl">Players in pairs. One player, uses her voice and body to produce any sound she wishes. The other player interprets those sounds through movements, acting in synchronization with the first player\'s sound track. Exchange roles after a while. \n \nAs a variation, the player doing the movement controls the player doing the sounds. \n \nAlternatively, each player leads in turn without a predefined order.</item>
        <item name="RepairShop">One player leaves the stage (or gets a headphone). Audience provides an object, and something not-so-obvious that is wrong with the object. Example: an airliner for which the keys to open the door have been lost. In the game the player that is \'it\' needs to solve the problem, without knowing what the problem is. As soon as she finds out the game is over. \nAs a variation, bring the object back to the shop where it was purchased. Shopkeeper should give hints as to what the object is. \nInstead of an object, use an animal that is sick, dead or does not do what was promised. Like a parrot that refuse to speak - Also known as Veterinarian Endowment. \n \nInvert it - have the shopkeeper guess what it is.</item>
        <item name="Repeater">Listening exercise. Any player that wants to offer a piece of dialog needs to repeat the entire dialog the last player did (ignoring that player\'s repetition of previous dialog) before she can offer her own input. Obviously not for performance.</item>
        <item name="ReplayGibberish">Exercise on Jabbertalk. Have 2 players do a short scene (1 minute or so). Then have them replay the scene in gibberish.</item>
        <item name="ReverseChairDance">You will need music for this exercise, and a bunch of chairs. \nStart by placing chairs in a circle, one chair less than the number of players. Play music, and have the players dance around the chairs. When the music stops, everyone should find a chair to sit on. The player that doesn\'t find a chair needs to find some other way to get his/her feet off the ground. \n \nRemove a chair and repeat. In the end, all players will have to find a way to not to touch the ground, by climbing and clinging on to each other. Make sure you got sturdy chairs; we\'ve known chairs to collapse under the weight of 10 players.. \n \nIt\'s important not to side coach - the group needs to figure out themselves how to solve the problem.</item>
        <item name="ReverseTrivialPursuit">Like most of the games in the Verbal wit category, no exactly theater, but fun if played well. \nAsk the audience for statements or facts, to which the players need to come up with the funniest question to which the statement/fact might be the answer. \n \nExample: \n \nStatement: Green Bananas \nQuestion: What is best avoided if you got constipation?</item>
        <item name="Revolver">4 players in a square; 2 in front, 2 behind them. The MC or host asks for an audience suggestion for the 2 players in front. Then the host asks the players to turn the square (to the right or to the left). So now we have a different combination of players in front. These 2 get an audience suggestion. Turn again and ask for suggestion again and do this once more. Then have players take their original position. \nThe game is played as follows: the 2 players in front start improvising a scene; the 2 players in the back move to the side to clear the stage. Players play until the host yells Call, at which time all players step back to their original positions in the square. MC then calls Right or Left, and square turns accordingly. The 2 players in front start playing a scene based on their suggestion until MC calls again. \n \nThis is repeated. When 2 players are up front for the second or third time, they continue their previously played scene. They can either plainly continue it, or continue at some time in the future (a day later, a year later, a century later). Also known as Diamond. Also known as Pan Left Pan Right. Also known as Turntable.</item>
        <item name="Rewind">For this handle we need a \'director\', or the MC can take on this role. A scene is started. The director can at any point interrupt the scene, and fast-forward (or backward) to another point in time. The story is then continued in that time. This technique employs both Flash Forward and Flashbacks. Also known as Fast Forward. See also Director\'s Cut.</item>
        <item name="Rhymes">Scene played in verses. The idea is that the first player offers a line, and the second player rhymes to that. Then the second player offers another line, with which the first player needs to make a rhyme. \nPlayers that hesitate or forget to rhyme \'die\' and are replaced by other players. The idea is to keep the story going, so players that can\'t find a good rhyme that would advance the story better die than screw up the story. \n \nSee also Verses.</item>
        <item name="Rituals">Get an everyday activity from the audience. Then play this activity as if it were a ritual. \nThink about religion, voodoo, sports, a NATO summit, whatever. You\'ll realize a lot of what we do is ritualized, just heighten that.</item>
        <item name="RockPaperScissors">Fun game to warm up and to teach players some Chivalry. Based off Alien Tiger Cow \nEveryone in a circle. There are 3 things a player can be: \n \nAn alien: hold you index fingers up next to your head, as little antenna\'s and say \'Bleeb bleeb\', bending inwards into the circle; \nA cow: bend forward, hold your right hand on your tummy and go \'Moooo\' \nA tiger: push your right hand forward, imitating a claw and roar. \nOn your sign, every player decides to become one of the three. The idea is for everyone to become the same, which obviously won\'t be the case, the first time. We re-do this until everyone is in sync. \n \nAs a variation, invent your own animals (or things) and let players become juke boxes, birds, whatever. \n \nPlay \'majority wins\': animals/things that are most in the minority drop out. This version is known as Rock Paper Scissors.</item>
        <item name="Rumors">Everyone in a circle. One person starts by saying Did you hear about.. and points to someone else. That player immediately replies affirmative and heigthens. After which everyone gasps or giggles. Person left to the second person restarts. \nThe blanks can be anything: something as simple as soup, or something as convoluted as the white bear who ate a Russian kid for lunch in Novosibirsk last Thursday.</item>
        <item name="Samurai">This is an excellent physical warm up. All players in a circle. One player is the Samurai - she starts by lifting her Katana (sword), making a Japanese- nsounding grunt. She keeps her sword up in the air, and her 2 neighbors slaughter her, by swinging their swords into her sides, again grunting enthusiastically and in pseudo-japanese. When the neighbors retract their swords, the Samurai lowers her sword; while doing this she makes eye contact with another player, when then becomes Samurai, and everything starts all over again. \nStart slowly, and then increase the tempo.</item>
        <item name="SatelliteRadio">Excellent listening exercise. Players in pairs. Establish a beat. Player 1 provides a story, one word per beat. Player 2, within the beat, repeats the story, but with one beat delay (like the delay we have on a satellite radio). \nTry with 2 or 3 beats delay as well. See also Satellite TV for an variation on this exercise.</item>
        <item name="SatelliteTV">Same as Satellite Radio, but with movements. Players in pairs. Establish a beat. Player 1 makes a new movement on every beat. Player 2 mirrors the movements, but with a delay of 1 beat. \nTry a delay of 2 or 3 beats as well. See also Bidirectional Satellite TV for an extension of the exercise.</item>
        <item name="ScenePainting">Technique for building/advancing scenes. To be used sparingly. \nThe idea is that any player can stop the scene by yelling freeze, step out of character, and describe something within the scene, without interrupting what is going on in the scene. After nthe comment, player unfreezes the scene and steps back into character. \n \nExample. 2 players in a scene where a backpacker is looking for a bed at a house where an old lady lives. Backpacker comments on the fact that the house is chock full of stuffed animals, an little pictures of backpackers, thereby implying that the old lady kills and stuffs backpackers (idea stolen from a short story by Roald Dahl). \n \nSee also Asides for another game with uses a similar technique.</item>
        <item name="SceneReplay">Ask 2 players to play a short scene. One could limit the scene to 8 lines of dialog per player. Then ask the players to replay the scene, based on some audience suggestions for a different location.</item>
        <item name="SceneToMusic">A silent scene is played, in which the characters\' emotions are controlled by the music.</item>
        <item name="SceneInTheDark">Fairly obvious: a scene is played in the dark. See also The Bat. \nIf the theater is really dark, then moving about on the scene can make quite a lot of disruptive noise. You may want to do a \'radio play\', where all players just sit on the stage, and provide the words and (background) noises for the scene.</item>
        <item name="Scorpion">A number of players stand in the middle of the room, eyes closed the others stand by the walls. One of the middle players is tapped on the shoulder, she become the \'killer\' or the \'vampire\'. The trainer give a go-sign, and all \'blinded\' players start milling around the room. When the killer bumps into someone, she squeezes that persons forearm to \'kill\' him. When a victim dies, he utters a scream, opens his eyes and is \'out\'. \nGame is over when all potential victims are dead. \n \nAudience by the walls make sure that blind players don\'t bump into stuff or hurt themselves. \n \nAs a variation, when a \'vampire\' runs into a victim, the victim becomes a vampire too \nWhen 2 vampires bump into one anther, they become normal mortal souls again \nAlso known as Blind Hunt. Also known as Screamers. Also known as Haunted House. Also known as Blind Stalker. Also known as Vampire Game. See also Death and Retriever</item>
        <item name="Screamers">A number of players stand in the middle of the room, eyes closed the others stand by the walls. One of the middle players is tapped on the shoulder, she become the \'killer\' or the \'vampire\'. The trainer give a go-sign, and all \'blinded\' players start milling around the room. When the killer bumps into someone, she squeezes that persons forearm to \'kill\' him. When a victim dies, he utters a scream, opens his eyes and is \'out\'. \nGame is over when all potential victims are dead. \n \nAudience by the walls make sure that blind players don\'t bump into stuff or hurt themselves. \n \nAs a variation, when a \'vampire\' runs into a victim, the victim becomes a vampire too \nWhen 2 vampires bump into one anther, they become normal mortal souls again \nAlso known as Blind Hunt. Also known as Scorpion. Also known as Haunted House. Also known as Blind Stalker. Also known as Vampire Game. See also Death and Retriever</item>
        <item name="ScriptTease">This is a Long Form format. Instead of getting suggestions from the audience, a (preferably well known local) writer is invited to provide the first two pages of a non existing novel. These pages are read to the audience (preferably by the writer herself) and the rest of the story is then improvised. \nThe format is attributed to the National Theatre of the World in Toronto. As far as we know the format is copyrighted; you\'ll need permission to perform it.</item>
        <item name="Sculptors">Works best with an even number of players. Split the group in 2. One half forms a circle in the middle of the room, facing outwards. The other half positions themselves, each player in front of one of the players in the middle circle. \nThe middle players are clay, or stone, and the outsiders are sculptors. Let each sculptor do something to his lump of clay, then make the sculptors rotate clockwise. Everyone now stands in front of someone else\'s block of stone or lump of clay. Have them work some more on the sculpture and rotate again. Repeat till every player is in front of his original piece of stone again. \n \nThen ask the sculptors to introduce their work, and give it a name. \n \nAs a variation, each statue or sculpture has a built in voice chip that can utter exactly one sentence. Let the sculptors switch on the voice chip at the end of their explanation. \nExcellent exercise to try with a new group to see who is Mr. Nice Guy. Players that keep placing the sculptures in positions that are impossible to maintain or physically painful can easily be spotted with this exercise. \nOther thing to watch for is which players undo the work the previous artists made. The idea is to build art together, not to destroy previously done work in order to push your own ideas. Make this clear by asking the sculptors, when they\'re in front of their original work again, to what extent the works still looks anything like what they started with.</item>
        <item name="SecretsEndowment">2 players. Audience provides a secret for both; players do not hear their own secret but know the secret of the other. Then they try to endow the other players with their secrets.</item>
        <item name="SevenUp">Everyone in a circle, start counting to 7 while waving right arm up and down to the same rhythm you\'re counting. After 7 switch to the other arm, then the right leg, then the other leg. At the end of the last leg of 7 go back to the original arm and do the same thing counting to 6, and so on down to 1â€“1â€“1â€“1.</item>
        <item name="SexWithMeIsLike">This is a game of wits. A suggestion is called from the audience, say chocolate milk. Players line up and when so inspired, come forward explaining why sex with them is like the suggestion. Example: sex with me is like chocolate milk: hot and sweet. \nVery similar to Worlds Worst and One Eighty Five.</item>
        <item name="Shootout">Excellent game to get to know each other\'s names. \nEverybody\'s a cowboy or cowgirl, you get them in a circle and ask them to test their revolvers. Have them shoot up in air, not at each other (yet). Then ask the group to concentrate; when everybody\'s quiet, call someone\'s name. That person needs to drop to the floor as fast as he can. His neighbors take a shot a him; if he\'s not down r fast enough, he dies (making grueling sounds). If he\'s down before a gun is fired, the neighbor who fired last dies. \n \nInsist that for every shot there should be at least one victim. If\'s there\'s any confusion about who shot first, they should all spontaneously die. \n \nRepeat till only 2 players are alive. Place those 2 back to back in the middle of the room, and give them a sign to start walking away from each other. When they hear you drop a coin (or a key ring, or whatever) they turn around as fast as they can and shoot the other. Again, at least one victim, and if they\'re not sure who shot first they should both gladly die. \n \nAs a variation, a shot can only be fired after a player has made a 360 degree spin. \nAnother variation is to have players walk around. Whoever gets caught in cross fire is dead. \n \nThis is really a game about Chivalry and not about winning. Use this game early in a workshop to spot the students that stubbornly refuse to be shot and correct them. You could consider your moment of death you moment of glory - show off how willing you are to accept you own death, and die with enthusiasm.</item>
        <item name="ShrinersWarmup">Perfect game to learn each other\'s names. \nEveryone in a circle. One person (A) starts by calling another person\'s name (B). At that point, A starts walking towards B. Before A gets to B, B needs to call another name Â©, so B frees her spot in the circle, for A to take. C then needs to call yet another name and start walking, so B can take C\'s spot. \n \nAs a variation, instead of calling names, players can pick another player by making eye contact (and nodding to acknowledge that eye contact has been made). This demands a lot of concentration. \nYou can have more than one cycle going, if the group is big enough. Also known as Name Game. Also known as Cross Circle.</item>
        <item name="Sideways">In this game we play a scene, in which the back wall is the \'floor\', and the floor is a wall. So, if you are \'standing\' in the scene, you would be lying on the floor, and if you\'re lying down, you\'d really be standing against the back wall. \nThis setup allows players to so all kinds of weird things, like defying gravity, or become a bat that\'s hanging upside down off the wall.</item>
        <item name="SillyStinkySexy">4 players. Each player endows each of the other players with either sexy-ness, silly-ness or stinky-ness. Have them play a scene in which people come together, at a party, a picnic, in church. Afterwards, ask the audience if they could see who endowed who with what.</item>
        <item name="SimonSays">You are Simon, and you tell the players to do exactly what Simon tells them to do, but only if Simon\'s sentence starts with Simon says. Any time a player does what Simon tells her to do, without preceding that with Simon says is out. \nTell the players the game starts when you say Simon says the game has started. Then try to trick them into doing stuff they\'re not supposed to do. Ask them e.g. if they understand the rules; whoever nods is out. Try telling players that are out they can join in again; if they do they\'re out again.</item>
        <item name="SimpleContinuation">A scene is started, played by 2 to 4 players. Mid-scene the MC interrupts, and all characters are replaced by new players. The new players should take over the original characters, and stick to the story that was being developed. \nAlso known as Understudy. Also known as Actor Switch.</item>
        <item name="SittingStandingLying">Silly game to teach fast acting. \n3 players play a scene. At any point in time, there should always be one player standing, one player sitting and one player lying down. As soon as a sitter stands up, the stander needs to sit down. \n \nTry to justify the moves ! \n \nAs a variation, improv troupe Icebox called in with the following variation: Glad Sad Mad. Same handle.</item>
        <item name="SixEpisodes">Excellent game to teach group storytelling. Give a big task, like \'The launch of a new flavor of coke\', or \'Building a new clubhouse for the girl scouts\'. The players get 1 minute to prepare 6 scenes, in which the given task needs to be completed. After 1 minute there is no more discussing, they just play the 6 scenes. \nTime it and see if they can make their minds up. Quarreling will just slow them down, so this will only work if players agree; they should be immediately Accepting any usable ideas.</item>
        <item name="SlapTake">Very silly. But hey we\'re an encyclopedia so here we go: 2 players do a scene, each holding a glass of water (or coke, or beer). After every sentence players take a spit. Or take a spit after the other player said a line. Or both. \nSee also Spit Take.</item>
        <item name="SlappyFace">A simple word association played in pairs. If a player is too slow, of goed \'Erm..\' the other slaps him in the face (gently). Adding the notion of danger helps some people to say whatever comes to mind.</item>
        <item name="SlideShow">Give one player a big activity, perhaps a trip through the jungle, or the construction of a home. This player needs to present a slide show; the other players will play what\'s in the slides. \nThe idea is that the story is built both by the presenter, and by the images the other players present in the slides. Sidecoach players not to simply just \'build\' what the narrator has described, but to extend it, to build/show the sequel or next step in the story.</item>
        <item name="SloMoSamurai">Tell the players they are Samurai, and their right forearm is a poisoned sword. Then have them do a slow motion sword fight. \nThe only way to fend off a \'sword\' is by blocking it with your right arm. If another player\'s sword touches your body on any other part than your right forearm, you die a gruesome death (also in slow motion). \n \nPlayers should not speed up when they are about to get \'killed\', but rather \'let themselves be killed\'. Good game to teach a little Chivalry. \nAlso known as Poison Arms.</item>
        <item name="SloMoTag">Play tag, but in slow motion. Immensely entertaining if played well; players are not to escape the tagger by making a sudden movement, and the tagger cannot lash out to tag another player. Tell players to breathe, scream and groan in slow motion. \nYou may want to have the players exercise walking in slow motion first, to make sure they are aware of how they (naturally) move, and learn how to stick with that in slow motion.</item>
        <item name="SloMoWorldChampion">3 players, and an every day activity (brushing your teeth, washing your car). \nIn this game, the every day activity is performed as if it were done at the olympics or at a world championship. One player is the athlete, and the two others are in a TV studio - one is the interviewer who interviews the athlete\'s trainer, as the athlete performs the task. \n \nUsually, something goes wrong and the athlete fails miserably. Gimmicks may include: \n \nInterviewing the athlete on the field after the win (or the disaster) \nAsking for a replay of a particularly dramatic moment \nAsking for a replay with a different camera (different angle) \nAlso known as Sportz Center.</item>
        <item name="SmartFellas">Everyone in a circle. First person starts with saying one smart fella HE felt smart. This is only said at the start of the round. Next person says  two smart fellas THEY felt smart. This is said on any number that DOES NOT have a 3 in it or a multiple of 3 (i.e. 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14 etc) next person must say 3 smart fellas THEY ALL felt smart. This is said on any number that does have a 3 in it or a multiple of 3 (i.e. 3, 6, 9, 12, and 13 also, 15 etc). \nIf anyone incorrectly says the phrase (i.e. TWO smart fellas they ALL felt smart) that person is out and the game recommences. n \n \nBefore you know it, the game becomes a tongue twister. For example: One fart smeller he smelt fart.</item>
        <item name="Soap">This Long Form improv game is played with 6 to 15 players. 2 players start a scene, perhaps based on an audience suggestion. In the middle of the scene, any other player can call \'Cut\', and start another scene, dragging one or more other players in the scene. n \nAll scenes are interrupted this way, and the idea is that all scenes come together in one story. Cut scenes can be continued later. Usually, every player sticks to one character. \n \nThis game can be played with or without a director. Also known as Cut. \n \nAs a variation, usually, we decide on a category before the start of this game. Possible categories are \nSoap series, like The Bold and the Beautiful, Dallas, Eastenders \nHospital drama, like E.R. \nCop drama, like Hill Street Blues \nRomantic Comedy, like The Love Boat \nCrime series or murder mysteries</item>
        <item name="SoapSeries">Play an episode from a soap series. This can be done as a Long Form, but can also be used in short form. The idea is to use (and abuse) the techniques used in soap series. Typically this involves several story lines running at the same time, each story progressing in tiny steps. Other elements that can be used or spoofed are: \npoor acting \nsettings like oil industry, hospitals, fashing industry \nsituations where everyone is involved with everyone, including weird plot twists where characters suddenly discover they are related.</item>
        <item name="Solitaire">All players but one spread along opposing edges of a wide surface. The player in the middle runs from one end of the space with closed eyes. The others prevent the runner from deviating too much left/right, and catch the runner at the end. \nThis is more difficult than it sounds - it\'s like after a couple of steps most people start sensing a looming wall in front of them.</item>
        <item name="SoloDoors">A Solo exercise. Enter, as a character, through a door. Make the environment clear (by means of the (kind of) door. In that environment, address your character as a different character, then one of the characters (you again) leaves (through the door, or through another door/window/hole/whatever). \nDo this fairly fast and long enough so you run through your easy characters. You can shelve any interesting characters you discover of course. \n \nExcellent exercise to help you establish the Platform. This is like a solo variation on Ding Characters.</item>
        <item name="SomethingOldSomethingNew">An excellent group improv game to train listening skills. Taken from tho old wedding adage, Something old, Something new, Something borrowed, Something blue. \n5 players, one player - the bride, leaves the room. The remaining 4 players each get one of the following from the audience: \n \nSomething old \nSomething new \nSomething borrowed \nSomething blue \nThe idea is that player number 5, the Bride, needs to guess each of the 4 players items. Game ends when all 4 items have been guessed. \n \nThe players need to provide hints to the bride, but they cannot explicitly tell the bride what they are or what they have. Similar in essence to The Party. \n \nWorks best if players help the bride by providing hints as to the other characters items. The players can chose to be the item or simply have the item and try and present it to the bride only dropping hints. One example; Something old = Abacus, Something new = IPhone (new at time of writing), Something borrowed = Chainsaw, Something blue = Blue Whale. Very important that the 4 players (not the bride) pay attention to the other players items and are available to drop hints to help it along. \nContributed by Scared Sciptless Improv.</item>
        <item name="SoundCircle">Everybody in a big circle. One player starts the game by making a gesture and a sound to his right neighbor. The neighbor immediately imitates gesture and sound, then turns to his right neighbor and makes a totally different gesture and sound. \nTell players not to preconceive, ask them to throw themselves into this exercise. \n \nAs a variation, instead of passing the sound/gesture to your neighbor, players can pass it to any player in the circle. \nTry the game without imitating the sound/gesture received; just have players turn around and throw a new gesture/sound to their neighbors as fast as possible. \nAlso known as Pass Catch.</item>
        <item name="SoundEffects">A scene is played, and one or more off-scene players provide all the sounds. Players on scene are allowed to speak, but cannot make other sounds. The idea is that the FX folks add to the scene, not merely support it.</item>
        <item name="SoundsLikeASong">Play a scene (or series of scenes). At any time, anyone can stop the scene and say \'Sounds like a song\', after which the player(s) sing a song based on the last line that was spoken, or last action that was done.</item>
        <item name="SpaceJump">This is like an extended Freeze Tag game. \n4 players. One player starts miming an every day activity or routine. A second player (or the MC) calls Freeze and the first one freezes. Second player builds another scene based on the frozen position of the first player. \n \nThe other 2 players enter the same way. Once players 3 and 4 are in, as soon as Freeze is called, 2 and 3 take on their positions in which they were frozen, and continue their scene. And so on backwards. \n \nAs soon as player 1 is back alone in his activity, he needs to finish it and that ends the game. \n \nAs a variation, when a scene is continued, keep adding players until everyone is in, then work your way backwards. When a previous cene is continued, the players continue in the future, perhaps in a new location, and they fustify their new physical positions - Growing and Shrinking Machine.</item>
        <item name="Speck">One player plays an improvised scene. The other player(s) play the voice(s) of objects in the environment in which the first player plays. \nAnything can have a voice. Examples: \n \na player walks in a forest and an ant starts talking to him \na player is in the bathroom and his toothbrush starts talking \nAs a variation, you can script the text of the little voice, and have the player justify anything that is said. See Actor\'s Nightmare. See Evil Stick of Gum for a different variation of the same improv game. \nMake sure players immediately make clear what exactly is doing the talking. Either the voice makes this clear, or the other player: \nOh my god, a talking duck with a machine gun! \nBet you\'ve never seen a talking couch, have you? \nPlay Name the Monster in combination with this game. Also known as Little Voice.</item>
        <item name="SpitTake">Very silly. But hey we\'re an encyclopedia so here we go: 2 players do a scene, each holding a glass of water (or coke, or beer). After every sentence players take a spit. Or take a spit after the other player said a line. Or both. \nSee also Slap Take.</item>
        <item name="SplitFocus">This can be used as a game handle, or as a technique in Long Form. The idea is to have more than one scene going on in parallel. Obviously, only one scene at the time can have Focus, so the trick is to organically move the focus from one scene to the other and back. If focus goes from scene 1 to scene 2 and focus does not return to scene 1 we have an Organic Edit.</item>
        <item name="SplitScreen">Divide the stage in a left and a right half. The right part becomes the left and vice versa, and the division in the middle becomes a \'wall\'. \nThen play a scene with 4 players and only 2 characters. When a player leaves the stage to the left hand side, his character, played by another player, should enter from the right. \n \nThe character should stay the same, even though it\'s played by a different player. \n \nThe center of the stage cannot be crossed as it is a wall. As a gimmick one might decide to make a hole in the wall, but stepping through this hole would make the character appear at the other side of the \'room\' - hard to justify..</item>
        <item name="SpoonRiver">This is a improv format that consists of monologues. The story is not played, but told. The players (typically 3 or 4) line up in front of the audience, Based on a single audience suggestion they all tell the same story, each as their own character in that story. \nThe play usually starts with every character introducing him or herself.

        <item name="SporkRiver">This is a improv format that consists of monologues. The story is not played, but told.

        <item name="SportzCenter">3 players, and an every day activity (brushing your teeth, washing your car). \nIn this game, the every day activity is performed as if it were done at the olympics or at a world championship. One player is the athlete, and the two others are in a TV studio - one is the interviewer who interviews the athlete\'s trainer, as the athlete performs the task. \n \nUsually, something goes wrong and the athlete fails miserably. Gimmicks may include: \n \nInterviewing the athlete on the field after the win (or the disaster) \nAsking for a replay of a particularly dramatic moment \nAsking for a replay with a different camera (different angle) \nAlso known as SloMo World Champion.</item>
        <item name="Squeezer">Get everyone into a circle, holding hands. One player starts the game by squeezing the hand of one of his neighbors. The receive then squeezes the hand of his other neighbor, thus generating a \'squeeze wave\' through the circle. \nAs a variation, squeezes can run in different directions, and you can have more than one squeeze wave cycling through the circle at a time \nInstead of squeezing, you can make players communicate by pressing (or even slapping) hands together \nSqueezes can run at different rates - this can be controlled by letting nobody squeeze their neighbors as long as the squeeze they receive is not over yet \nYou can have one player try to \'detect\' the squeeze (try and squeeze as unnoticeably as possible) \nAlso known as Hands.</item>
        <item name="StandardMusical">A standard musical is a Straight Story wrapped as a musical. A musical typically starts with a big opening number, and ends with a big finale.</item>
        <item name="Statues">Everyone starts milling about the room. Any player may decide to stop walking at any time. As soon as one player stops walking, everyone needs to freeze in position. As soon as everyone is froze, start walking again. \nObviously, the idea is for the group to freeze as quickly as possible. \n \nAs a variation, let all players make noises, hum, whistle as they mill about. The noisier, the more challenging the exercise becomes. Also known as Group Freeze. See also Walking by Numbers.</item>
        <item name="StorySpine">This is an idea/tool about the spine of any story. The whole point of the tool is to provide a model for a well-constructed story with a beginning that establishes a routine, an event that breaks the routine, a middle that shows the consequences of having broken the routine, a climax that sets the resolution to the story in motion, and the resolution. It goes like: \n \nOnce upon a time.. \nEvery day.. \nBut, one day.. \nBecause of that.. \nBecause of that.. \nBecause of that.. \nUntil, finally.. \nAnd, ever since then.. \nAnd, here\'s how the lines correlate to the different sections of a well-constructed story: \n \nThe Beginning that establishes the routine: Once upon a time.. Every day.. \n \nThe Event that breaks the routine: But, one day.. \n \nThe Middle that shows the consequences of having broken the routine: Because of that.. \nBecause of that.. \nBecause of that.. \nThe Climax that sets the resolution to the story in motion: Until, finally.. \n \nThe Resolution And, ever since then.. \n \nThis little structure teaches performers to advance a story by changing things. There are hundreds of variations known to this, one of which we\'ll present here as well: \n \nThe balance: Once upon a time.. and every day.. \nThe un-balance: But then one day.. \nThe quest for a resolution:.. and because of that.. and so.. until finally.. \nThe new balance:.. and ever since that day.. \nThe original story spine was created by Kenn Adams who also kindly offered the summary text above to this site. Kenn has a book published on this topic: The Art of Spontaneous Theater.</item>
        <item name="StoryStoryDie">Players form a line on the stage. A title for a story, and a story genre is obtained from the audience. The MC starts the game by pointing to a player, who needs to start telling the story. At any point in time the MC can switch to another player, who needs to continue the story flawlessly, even if the switch happened in the middle of a sentence or even in the middle of a word. \nPlayers that hesitate, or whose sentences are not grammatically correct or don\'t make sense, are boo-ed out of the game, by the audience yelling \'Die\'. The last player left nends the story. \n \nAlso known as Conducted Story.</item>
        <item name="StoryToAChair">A Solo character exercise. Tell a story to a few chairs. Any story, and the story does not really matter. Then, as you go, start playing all the characters. Feel free to narrate in between. \nMake your story such that it becomes easy to establish the character. Start with something like \'Jodi didn\'t really like leaving the house\' â€” which would point yourself to playing somebody with an outdoor phobia.</item>
        <item name="StraightStory">A Straight Story is a story that simply runs straight forward in time: one story line, no flashbacks, no sidestories.</item>
        <item name="Stretching">As a warm-up, let\'s do some simple stretching exercises. Everyone in the group shows a stretch of a body part, and that is then done by all others. Repeat until the whole body has been stretched. \nOn a silly note, try stretching unstretchable body parts: eye balls, ears, hair, noses, toenails.</item>
        <item name="StuntDouble">A scene is played by 2 players. Every time a player needs to do something difficult/unpleasant, another player jumps in as a stunt double. When done, the stunt double freezes the scene and the original player continues the scene.</item>
        <item name="StyleReplay">Ask 2 players to play a short scene. One could limit the scene to 8 lines of dialog per player. Then ask the players to replay the scene, based on some audience suggestions for a film / TV / literature style. Also known as Scene Replay in a more generalized form. \n \nAs a variation, you can time the scene to 1 minute, and then replay in 30 seconds, 15 seconds, 7 seconds and 3 seconds. \nThis variation is also known as Countdown and also known as Half Life. \n \nOther variations: \n \nhave the scene replayed by 2 other players \ninsist that the dialog remains exactly the same \nSee also Replay Gibberish.</item>
        <item name="Subtitles">2 players play an improvised story in Gibberish, 2 others translate. The idea is to build the story together: the \'actors\' give elements to the translators, and the translators can help steer the action for the \'actors\'. Also known as Foreign Movie or Foreign Film Dub.</item>
        <item name="SungStoryDie">This is like Story Story Die, but sung. Get a suggestions, and sing a song to that suggestion. When the host points to another player, that player continues the song. Both music and lyrics should fit flawlessly, otherwise the player is out. \nCan be done with an without a musician. Without is a bit easier as the rhythm can be broken a bit more easily. Then again, continuing the musical line can be more difficult.</item>
        <item name="SuperHeroes">A great Pimping game. 4 players. First player gets from the audience a silly little problem, like My Shoelaces are Untied, and a simple object, say a kitchen cabinet. \nFirst player starts a scene in which the Problem arises, and his character is unable to fix the problem. Hence she calls in (explicitly) the help of e.g. Kitchen Cabinet Woman. This is a Super Hero, like Superman, Wonder Woman, you know that kind of cartoon-character hero types. \n \nOur Super Hero comes in with lots of brou-haha (high Status ) only to make the problem worse (and a status switch to low status). So our hero calls in the help of yet another Super Hero. Use whatever you can think of first. Say Toothpaste Man. Again this hero comes in high status, screws up even more, does a status switch and calls in yet another hero, who finally fixes the problem. \n \nThe game is really pimping folks into playing outrageous superheroes. The status switch from high to low after screwing up is pretty important too here. \n \nSee also Mr. So and So for another Pimping game.</item>
        <item name="SuperheroEndowment">Audience provides a new brand of superhero. E.g. toothbrushwoman. Audience also provides 2 strengths and perhaps 1 weakness for this superhero. Others try to endow player one with the name, strengths and weakness of the new brand of superhero.</item>
        <item name="SupermanJam">Divide the audience into three groups; label them Group 1, 2, 3, (or any other labeling). Each group gets their own phrase to sing (or yell); it\'s important that the rhythm and length of each phrase is identical. \nGroup 1 sings Superman, Superman, Superman, Superman \nGroup 2 sings I want to jam with Superman. I want to jam with Superman. \nGroup 3 sings I want to jam; I want to jam; I want to jam with Superman. \nThen, the MC directs the audience through singing the song, first one group, then two, then all three, then just two, then just one, then two, then another loud, another soft, etc.</item>
        <item name="Supernova">All players dispersed around the room, have everyone stand up comfortably, feet apart, eyes closed. Ask your players to imagine they\'ve got a ball of energy hiding in their chests, radiating warm light. Ask them to imagine this light and energy starts filling their chest, their arms and legs, their hands and feet, their head, their whole body. \n \nThen ask the players to imaging this light starts shining out of their bodies, through their eyes, their fingers and toes, filling the whole room. Then imagine the light starts filling the whole building, the street, the city, the country, the whole world. \n \nFinally, imagine this warm light starts reaching into the skies, up to the moon, overpowering the sun, filling the whole of the universe. \n \nEnd the exercise by asking the players to open their eyes.</item>
        <item name="SurpriseMovement">Have everyone walk around leisurely. Tell them to stop and start make a movement, a gesture, a sound, anything really. Let the players repeat the gesture until they know what they \'are\'. \nThe idea is not to preconceive, but to let it happen. Players may turn out to be dish washers, ushers, lawn mowers, ping pong balls, whatever. Explain that there are no wrong answers. \n \nTell the players just to acknowledge what they \'are\' for themselves, and then move on, stop again and make another gesture/movement/sound.</item>
        <item name="Survivor">Four to six players play a scene. Then the audience chooses one of the players to get voted off the island. The remaining players do the scene again, covering everything that happened the first time. Then another person gets voted out, and so on until one person has to act out the scene all by themselves. \nThere are various ways of re-playing the original scene, even when only one player left: player can do a monologue, can play all original characters herself, you name it.. \n \nYou can play this for an audience, but it\'s also a great listening and paying-attention exercise. \n \nThe Improvoholics mailed Improv Encyclopedia to claim they developed this game.</item>
        <item name="SwedishSculptors">This one is an extension of Sculptors. Divide the class in 2 groups, same number of players in every group. One group is clay, and they close their eyes. The other group are sculptors. \nThe sculptors build one sculpture out of all the \'clay\' players. The sculpture is finished when all of the players touch someone else (so all are connected to the sculpture). The artists cannot \'push\' the clay into position - they need to \'pull\' parts of the clay into position without actually pulling. \'Pulling\' is done by touching a body part with an open hand, and then moving the hand about. They \'clay\' players need to \'follow\' the moving open hands. \n \nAs soon as the sculpture is finished, the sculptors moves away, and re-build the statue, themselves now becoming clay. The (original) clay players keep their eyes closed. As soon as the imitation sculpture is finished, the clay players, eyes still closed, try to find \'themselves\' in the imitation. When everybody has found themselves the game is over, and the clay players assess to what extent they found \'themselves\' and to what extent the imitation is exact. \n \nDescribed in Augusto Boal \'s Games for Actors and Non-actors.</item>
        <item name="SwitchGibberish">Jabbertalk exercise: let a player tell a store. Whenever you ring a bell (or clap your hands) player switches to Gibberish - the story should continue and should make sense. \nIf you do this as an exercise, try sidecoaching with different kinds of gibberish. Try any language you don\'t know (Mongolian, Italian, Russian, Chinese, you name it).</item>
        <item name="Switcheroo">This is like Simple Continuation, except that the MC interrupts the scene several times, and at each interruption all actors in the scene get switched; no new actors join in, and no actors leave. Also known as Actor Switch. See also Hat Continuation.</item>
        <item name="Sybil">This is basically a one-person Long Form. In this format the player plays all characters. The play typically starts with a character monologue and then goes into scenes alternated with more monologues. \nOne could summarize the \'rules\' as: \n \nyou play all the characters and their dialogue in the scenes \nmonologues are either internal (to the character) or to the audience, addresses as a group (a minister preaching to a church, a person introducing himself at a job interview). \nThe format is attributed to Andy Eninger. The name is based on a book with the same title, about Sybil Dorsett, a survivor of child abuse who was diagnosed with the first multiple personality disorder. She allegedly played host to 16 separate personalities. \nMore info can be found on www.sybilization.com.</item>
        <item name="SynchroClap">All players in a circle. One player starts the game by making eye contact with another player. Then, both clap their hands simultaneously. The \'receiving\' player then makes eye contact with another player, and they synchro-clap. And so on. \nOnce a firm rhythm is established, start accelerating slowly.</item>
        <item name="TVNews">3 players, who play characters in a TV newscast. One will be the lead anchor, another will do the weather, and the third is a reporter at a location. Then, a newscast is played. \nAs a variation, ask for an audience suggestion for a central theme in the newscast.</item>
        <item name="TagOut">This is a format, and an performance trick at the same time. As a format, it can be used for Short Form performances as well as for Long Form work. \n \nThe premise is simple: Transitions between scenes are made by tagging out (a) player; the other player(s) remain in the scene and the person who tagged joins in, starting a scene at a different time and/or location. \n \nTagOuts as a format are described in Art By Committee, and the book has good examples on the video included.</item>
        <item name="Tapestry">This is a long form improv format, origin unknown, and has resemblance to a Harold. \n \nThe parent form, 5â€“4â€“3â€“2â€“1, can be played with 4 to 12 players. In this format the audience provides 5 different themes, objects, emotions, locations or situations. Then, the game is played in 5 rounds. \n \nIn the first round 5 scenes are played, each based on one of the audience suggestions. These scenes are totally unrelated. After the first round the audience decides which of the 5 scenes seen should be discontinued. \n \nIn the second round, the 4 remaining scenes are continued, and links start to appear between these scenes. Again, after this, the audience decides which scene to dump. \n \nThis continues until after 4 rounds there are only 2 scenes left. In the fifth round these scenes come together in one final scene. This format can be played with or without props and/or director(s). \n \nAs a variation, this can also be played without dropping a scene line. In that case you\'d probably use 3 rather than 5 scenes. Also known as Triptych. Also known as Tapestry.</item>
        <item name="TellTales">In this format a cast of five gets one ask-for each at the top of the show, and then each person is free to play solo scenes with invisible characters, addressing the audience, musing to themselves, speaking on the telephone, just being physical and so on until another player enters, at which point they have to leave. Over the course of the performance a complete play is done. The actors can play multiple characters if they want. \nAttributed to the Spontaneity Shop (London).</item>
        <item name="TenFingers">Great game for getting to know each other in a new group. All players in a circle, holding all 10 fingers up in the air. One person at a time, start asking personal questions that take yes-no answers; whoever cannot answer yes to a question, drops a finger. Last person with a finger left wins.\n\n Good questions are things like I have a cat, I have never stolen anything and so on.</item>
        <item name="TheAdGame">Excellent warm-up, and great introduction to Accepting. \nPick an advertising campaign for an unknown / imaginary product. One player starts, saying Let\'s.. filling in what she wants to do. Then she starts actually doing what she said she wanted to do. A second player jumps in, saying Let\'s.. do something else, to advance the group activity. Both players say Yes, let\'s do that and start doing whatever suggested. Third player jumps in, suggests what to do, and again all players loudly agree to do it, and actually do it. Continue till everyone has suggested something. \n \nSee also Yes Lets - or Rather Not for a more advanced version of this exercise. \n \nIf the setup is a random group activity, then this game is also known as Yes Lets.</item>
        <item name="TheBag">This is a group exercise for building Characters. One player on a chair, up to 5 other players sit in front of her. The player on the chair starts by taking something out of a big mimed bag. She holds the object in front of her and names the object - anything that comes to mind is just fine (see Warehouse, Open Your Hand or Presents ). \nThe other players start asking the middle player questions about the object, why she has it, what it might mean to her. After a few questions, she is asked to take another object from the bag - again, this can be anything and need not be related to the first object that came up. This prompts more questions, and more objects. \n \nContinue until we know the character that is sitting on the chair. \n \nThe idea of the exercise is to construct the character as a group. Both objects, questions and answers to the questions will provide cues to who the person on the chair might be. Avoid very leading questions, although any element in the questions should probably be accepted. \nAs soon as the person on the chair has an idea of who she might be, what her state of mind might be, how old she might be, what her Status might be, she should start showing these qualities, until she really \'becomes\' the character. Use voice and body language to express this.</item>
        <item name="TheBat">This is a Long Form format based on Blind Harold. It is basically a long form played with the lights out in a theater. \nYou can download mp3 files of a couple of Bat performances off the website of the Impatients. \n \nThe format was created by Joe Bill of Annoyance Theatre in Chicago.</item>
        <item name="TheGerbil">Invent a silly dramatic story, and explain it to the audience. Classic example is the following: After fixing the roof, Roger decided to clean the house, including the cage of Mary\'s gerbil. He put the animal in a frying pan, from which it escaped to the roof, where it got stuck in some fresh tar. Roger put it back in it\'s cage, where it got smothered by the fresh woodchips. Roger tried to use a solvent to clean the creature, but the solvent fumes cause the creature to die of a cardiac arrest. At that point Mary walks in. \nThis is when the scene starts: Roger needs to explain what happens, but as soon as the audience starts laughing Roger is replaced by another player who gets a new shot. The idea is to try and play the scene without getting the audience to laugh. \n \nDon\'t stick to the gerbil story - you can invent any silly story for this game. \nAttributed to Keith Johnstone and described in Impro for Storytellers.</item>
        <item name="TheGoodTheBadAndTheUglyAdvice">3 players, form a line (or sit down). The audience provides questions or problems for which they need advice. The 3 players provide good, bad, and really bad advice. \nHave the MC choose who provide what advice, so everyone can have a stab at really bad advice. If the \'bad advice\' is really bad, then the Ugly advice should be even worse. \n \nYou can play this as a Die game - if a bad advice is not followed by an even worse advice, replace the last player by another one.</item>
        <item name="TheGauntlet">Set a clock for 10 minutes. Start with a character monologue. After no more than 60 seconds, you need slip into a two character scene with that character. \nThen you switch to related scenes, using various kinds of Transitions. The goals are \n \nto improvise nonstop for 10 minutes and \nto create as many characters and situations in 10 minutes as possible. \nThis exercise is attributed to Andy Eninger (see Sybil).</item>
        <item name="TheMagnet">Played in pairs. One player becomes a sculpture, standing still, while his partner closes her eyes. She needs to explore the statue, with her eyes closed, and then tries to become the same statue. \nSee also Swedish Sculptors for a similar exercise.</item>
        <item name="TheParty">One player plays a character that is having a party. The other players will be the guests, and the audience provides us with who the guests might be. Of course the host does not know who the guests are. His task is to guess who the guests might be, based on hints the guests offer. \nThe games is over as soon as the host has guessed all guests. \n \nAs a variation, use quirks instead of characters - Also known as Party Quirks.</item>
        <item name="TheReRun">An excellent exercise for Look and Listen. One player initiates a scene. Take your time establishing Platform. A second player joins the scene; this player may \'come in\', or alternatively he may have started on scene with the initiator. After the initiator has spoken his first line, the joiner repeats exactly what the initiator said. Then we interrupt. \nAsk the joiner what was established prior to the first line, as well as what the first line established. This slows down the scene so the joiner gets the time to fully grasp what his scene partner has given him. This goes both ways - what did the initiator get from the joiner (non-verbally)? \n \nThen re-run the start of the scene and let it develop.</item>
        <item name="TheScream">Everybody in a circle, watch the ground. On your sign, everybody lifts their head and either looks straight, left or right. Whenever 2 people look each other in the eyes, they scream as loud as they can, as if they\'re startled, and then drop dead. \nRepeat till only one or 2 players are alive. Also known as Jeepers Peepers.</item>
        <item name="TheatreSports">Theatre Sports is really a collection of formats. We\'ll summarize the general rules, and then describe the variations for the different sub-formats: \n \nThe game is introduced by an MC, who does a warm-up and then introduces the judges and the 2 teams \nThe game is lead by judges \nEach game has a fixed duration \nA toss decides which team starts with a challenge \nChallengers go first. Possible challenges are the classic games, but anything goes. One might challenge the other team to play the dullest scene possible. \nTeams can protest or baulk at a challenge. The judges may accept the baulk, in which case the challengers need to come up with a new challenge. Reason for baulking at a challenge might be we\'ve already done this game tonight. \nThe judges carry a horn, which they use to issue a warning for boring. After a warning the scene should be concluded ASAP. \nJudges can issue penalties, for e.g. obscenities, smart-assing or whatever. A punished player gets a basket over his head for a number of minutes \nScenes must end on time; the judges indicate the time, and warn the players e.g. when they got 30 seconds left. Or they honk a warning for boring, after which the scene must end. \nAfter each challenge (played by both teams) the audience decided by means of cheering, yelling of applause which team won, as interpreted by the judges. Winners get 5 points, losers get nothing. \nThe whole show lasts about 45 minutes. \nAs a variation, some troupes let the judges issue the challenges. Other troupes allow the winning team a free scene. \nDanish variety: in this format there is only one judge, called an Ombuds. The Ombuds is both Commentator, MC and scorekeeper. \n \nThis format is quite often played with props, in a dï¿½cor. Sound and light effects are also used. The Danish version is a bit simpler, and can be used to play with beginners. \n \nSome troupes start an evening off with a 20-minute Danish game, and then play a 45-minute full version after the intermission. \n \nTheatre sports are played all over the world, and teams from different cities and troupes quite often meet in competition. \n \nTheatresports is a registered trademark by Keith Johnstone. A complete overview can be found in his book Impro for Storytellers.</item>
        <item name="ThreeLineEnvironment">Played with 2 players. They get 3 lines (first player gets 2 lines, second one gets one line). Using no more than 3 lines (A-B-A) they need to establish their Platform ; who they are, where they are, when and why. \nSee also Doors.</item>
        <item name="ThreeLineIronman">The first three lines are very important, as they set up the basic emotions, location and relationship. One person stands in front of the group as the Ironman and gives an opening line. Someone else gives a response. The Ironman gives a third line in response to that. After, the same first line is given again to the next participant. She gives a different response, as does the Ironman, so that the 2nd and 3rd lines are different. Think on how this illustrates how much variation there can be in a scene between different players. No single actor can carry the entire scene. Once the Ironman has gone through all other actors, another takes his place.</item>
        <item name="ThreeLineSolo">This is a Solo exercise. Play a 3 line scene with 2 characters. Play both characters yourself. Repeat at high speed so you run through your \'easy\' characters fast.</item>
        <item name="ThreeLines">A great exercise to train scene start-ups. 2 players initiate a scene; the scene is broken off after 3 lines. The goal is to establish as much as possible as fast as possible. We want to understand the Platform, the Characters, the Environment and the points of view or drivers of the characters.\n\n Once 3 lines of dialog have been uttered, restart a different scene.</item>
        <item name="ThreeMelodies">Ask for 2 occupations. Then do a 4- beat scene as follows: \nPlayer 1 sings about how great and satisfying her job is, but she\'s missing something critical, or has a minor little problem with it (melody 1) \nNumber 2 does the same (to a second melody) \nBoth characters meet in a bar, complaining about their problems. They summarize their problem in one line each (to finish their song), something like I got plenty of x but I\'m missing y \nThen they solve each other\'s problem (fitting each other\'s x to the other\'s y), they do this in a duet to a third melody. \nSee also Bartender.</item>
        <item name="ThreeNoses">A fun and silly game. Let everyone walk leisurely around the room. When you shout \'3 Noses\' the players must form little groups, each group consisting of 3 touching noses. \nUse your imagination - as for 7 left big toes, 2 earlobes, 9 fingers, 4 nipples, 5 bellybuttons. Repeat till everyone is giggling. \n \nThis is a great game for new groups, as it lets the players get a feel (literally) for each other.</item>
        <item name="ThreeRules">Get 3 rules from the audience, e.g. players have only one arm, players can\'t use a word that contains an \'s\' and after every question uttered players needs to yell \'Yess!\'. Players then play a scene, obeying the 3 rules. For examples of what else might be used as a rule see the other games in the Limitations category. \nAlso known as Ahab and the Whale. (beats us why)</item>
        <item name="ThreeSentenceStory">2 players. 3 unconnected sentences are provided by one player; the other builds the shortest possible story incorporating the 3 sentences.</item>
        <item name="ThreeSeries">Everyone in a circle. Pick a category (e.g. make of cars, girls names, kinds of food, kinds of plants, whatever). First person states an example of the category, and points to someone else. Keep pointing. That someone else does the same, with a different item in the category, and so forth, until everyone points at one person.\n\n Then repeat the pattern. Make eye contact when passing your item to the next person. Drop the pointing arms when everyone is comfortable and the series is collectively memorized.\n\n Then do the same with a second category, and make sure the pointing pattern is different. Repeat till everyone is comfortable.\n\n Then do the same exercise, without pointing, and running the 2 categories at the same time. Add a third, fourth category if you wish. No pointing arms any more!\n\n The idea is not only to listen for the item right before yours in the series (so you know when its your turn), but also to make sure that when you pass an item to someone else, that someone else actually hears you. If not, then repeat your item, to ensure the series does not get broken. See also You.\n\n You can vary this game by adding another pattern by taking the next person\'s place in the circle.</item>
        <item name="ThreeSome">Fun warm-up. One player offers something, e.g. I am a slice of cheese. 2nd player jumps in and adds something to the offer, e.g. I am a slice of bread. 3rd player jumps in and again adds to the setup, e.g. I am a pickle. First player leaves, taking one of the others with him. Restart from the remaining player, who restarts by saying what/who she is.</item>
        <item name="ThroughTheAges">Ask 2 players to play a short scene. One could limit the scene to 8 lines of dialog per player. Then ask the players to replay the scene, based on some audience suggestions for: \na particular emotion. Also known as Emotion Replay. \nan era. Also known as Through the Ages. Also known as Historical Replay. \na different location \na film / TV / literature style. Also known as Style Replay. \nin Gibberish \nbackwards. Also known as Backwards Scene. \nAs a variation, you can time the scene to 1 minute, and then replay in 30 seconds, 15 seconds, 7 seconds and 3 seconds. \nThis variation is Also known as Countdown. and Also known as Half Life. \n \nOther variations: \n \nhave the scene replayed by 2 other players \ninsist that the dialog remains exactly the same \nSee also Replay Gibberish.</item>
        <item name="TimedScenes">Here are a couple of different ways to time scenes (apart from using your watch) \ntime a player can keep his head immersed in a bucket of water \ntime it takes the audience to throw 20 socks onto the stage \ntime it takes for an audience member to finish a beer (or a series of beers) \ntime it takes a player to go get a burger \nSee also Scene Replay for timed replayed scenes.</item>
        <item name="Timeline">A scene is played, number of players unlimited. The scene starts in prehistoric times, and evolves through the ages, till it ends in the future. \nThe idea is to stick to one and the same story line, but as time progresses, characters may take on characteristics or use attributes appropriate to the \'time\'. Of course, every characteristic and attribute needs to be justified and take the scene forward.</item>
        <item name="Tossing">Eight players form 2 lines, facing each other, and mesh their forearms together, to form a platform to \'launch\' another player up in the air and catch him again. Do make sure that your platform is sturdy (holding the other players by the wrists seems to be most solid). \nSee also Free Falling and Heave Ho for similar games.</item>
        <item name="Totems">Ask the audience for animals. Players play a scene, in which the characters are based on these animals. \nPlayers do not \'become\' the animals, they only take over characteristics of the animals. Characteristics may be physical, vocal or Status based. For example, \'chicken\' might ninspire a player to a cowardly character, moving about jerkily. \nAlso known as Animalistics. This can be played as an exercise: write totem names on slips of paper. Give every player a totem before they play a scene. You can extend the animal name; make it more specific. Play with things like Bald Eagle rather than Eagle; or Silver Moon, Sitting Bull, etc.</item>
        <item name="TouchToTalk">In this handle players play a scene in which they can only use speech when they touch each other. \nFun when played in locations when people don\'t usually touch each other, like a confession chair, a sauna. \nDon\'t go for the easy option of just touching your partner\'s forearm or shoulder - there are so many ways to touch each other. Try hugging, fighting, baptizing, tickling.</item>
        <item name="TranslateGibberish">This is best played with an odd number of players. Everyone in a circle. The first player gives a gibberish word to her right neighbor, who translates the word. The next player provides the next gibberish word, and so on. \nAs a variation, the receiver can provide both the translation, and a new gibberish word. \nYou may want to add the origin of the language along with the translation. \n \nAny gibberish word might be translated as \'banana\' of course, but that is not the idea of the exercise. For your translation, use the first thing that comes to mind. You may be inspired by the whole sound of the word (it might sound like something \'known\'), or parts of the word (only the vowels, or only the consonants), or by the intonation of the \'giver\', or even by her expression or body language. \nTry gibberish in different \'languages\' or \'accents\'. Also known as Gibberish Dictionary.</item>
        <item name="TriplePlay">This is really a series of 3 3-act plays mixed. Three separate plays are played, each based on different audience suggestions, and not related at all. We first see the three first acts for every play, then the three second acts, and finally the three final acts. \nAs a variation, some folks play each act in a different style, usually a kind of play (say Shakespeare), a kind of movie (say a spaghetti western) and something musical (say a musical or an opera). \nThe format was invented by Forrest Brakeman at LA Theatresports in 1989; it is licensed (you need a license to perform the format). Since 1989 LA Theatresports has morphed into Impro Theatre (LA).</item>
        <item name="Triptych">This is a long form improv format, origin unknown, and has resemblance to a Harold. \n \nThe parent form, 5â€“4â€“3â€“2â€“1, can be played with 4 to 12 players. In this format the audience provides 5 different themes, objects, emotions, locations or situations. Then, the game is played in 5 rounds. \n \nIn the first round 5 scenes are played, each based on one of the audience suggestions. These scenes are totally unrelated. After the first round the audience decides which of the 5 scenes seen should be discontinued. \n \nIn the second round, the 4 remaining scenes are continued, and links start to appear between these scenes. Again, after this, the audience decides which scene to dump. \n \nThis continues until after 4 rounds there are only 2 scenes left. In the fifth round these scenes come together in one final scene. This format can be played with or without props and/or director(s). \n \nTriptych is played just the same, only with 3 rounds and without dropping scene lines. Also known as Tapestry.</item>
        <item name="TrivialPursuit">MC asks the audience to pick Trivial Pursuit cards. Players line up, and the MC reads questions from the cards picked by the audience. Players invent the funniest answer to these questions. \nThe MC needs to screen the questions; a question like \'In what year electricity was invented\' should be avoided. As there are 6 questions on a card, go for the question that is vaguest and offers most options. \nAs a variation, read the answer, and let the players come up with the question. See also Reverse Trivial Pursuit.</item>
        <item name="TugOWar">Divide the class in 2 groups and have them mime a Tug-o-war fight. See if \nthe mimed rope does not stretch or shrink \nsomebody wins (i.e. one group gladly looses (see Chivalry ) \nAs a variation, do 2 per 2. Or try men against women.</item>
        <item name="TurkishArmyDrill">Great physical warm-up. We define 4 gestures, and each gets a number: \nOne: touch your forehead with your hands \nTwo: touch your shoulders with both hands \nThree: touch your hips with both hands \nTouch one foot with one hand (lift your foot) \nGame now goes as follows: \nSay one-two-three-four twice \nDo gesture one, say two-three-four - do this twice \nDo gestures one and two, say three-four, do all this twice \nDo gestures one, two, three, say four and do all this twice \nDo all gestures in order, twice \nRepeat all this at high speed.</item>
        <item name="TurningCircle">Fun game to warm up those muscles and get the blood pumping. \nEveryone in a circle. The circle starts running (slowly) clockwise. As soon as anybody shouts \'go\', the circle changes direction, without anybody bumping into someone else.</item>
        <item name="Turntable">4 players in a square; 2 in front, 2 behind them. The MC or host asks for an audience suggestion for the 2 players in front. Then the host asks the players to turn the square (to the right or to the left). So now we have a different combination of players in front. These 2 get an audience suggestion. Turn again and ask for suggestion again and do this once more. Then have players take their original position. \nThe game is played as follows: the 2 players in front start improvising a scene; the 2 players in the back move to the side to clear the stage. Players play until the host yells Call, at which time all players step back to their original positions in the square. MC then calls Right or Left, and square turns accordingly. The 2 players in front start playing a scene based on their suggestion until MC calls again. \n \nThis is repeated. When 2 players are up front for the second or third time, they continue their previously played scene. They can either plainly continue it, or continue at some time in the future (a day later, a year later, a century later). Also known as Revolver. Also known as Pan Left Pan Right. Also known as Diamond.</item>
        <item name="TwoHeadedProfessor">3 players: one is the interviewer, and the other 2 are an expert on a subject chosen by the audience. The expert is really one person, with 2 heads, and answers to the interviewer\'s question are provided word by word, one word at a time per player. \nAlso known as Two-headed Professor. Also known as Oracle. ; use an ancient Greek oracle instead of an expert, and have the audience ask the oracle questions about life and love. \n \nAs a variation, the interviewer can raise the stakes, e.g. by pimping the expert into a Word at a Time Song.</item>
        <item name="Typewriter">This is a nice handle to structure scenes. One of the players is the Narrator. He has a (mimed) typewriter and starts the scene by reading aloud as he types. As soon as the Narrator has given a few elements, the players take over and start playing the scene. \nAt any point, the Narrator can take over again, perhaps switch to another location, introduce new character, provide tilts or flashbacks. \n \nAs a variation, when a scene goes bad, the Narrator can mime ripping a couple of pages of his story apart, and restart the scene (or the story).</item>
        <item name="Understudy">A scene is started, played by 2 to 4 players. Mid-scene the MC interrupts, and all characters are replaced by new players. The new players should take over the original characters, and stick to the story that was being developed. \nAlso known as Simple Continuation. Also known as Actor Switch.</item>
        <item name="VampireGame">A number of players stand in the middle of the room, eyes closed the others stand by the walls. One of the middle players is tapped on the shoulder, she become the \'killer\' or the \'vampire\'. The trainer give a go-sign, and all \'blinded\' players start milling around the room. When the killer bumps into someone, she squeezes that persons forearm to \'kill\' him. When a victim dies, he utters a scream, opens his eyes and is \'out\'. \nGame is over when all potential victims are dead. \n \nAudience by the walls make sure that blind players don\'t bump into stuff or hurt themselves. \n \nAs a variation, when a \'vampire\' runs into a victim, the victim becomes a vampire too \nWhen 2 vampires bump into one anther, they become normal mortal souls again \nAlso known as Blind Hunt. Also known as Screamers. Also known as Haunted House. Also known as Blind Stalker. Also known as Scorpion. See also Death and Retriever</item>
        <item name="Verses">Scene is played in verses, that is, every player need to rhyme to herself. Nice handle to combine with a Shakespeare style. \nSee also Rhymes.</item>
        <item name="VeterinarianEndowment">Usually known as Repair Shop. One player leaves the stage (or gets a headphone). Audience provides an object, and something not-so-obvious that is wrong with the object. Example: an airliner for which the keys to open the door have been lost. In the game the player that is \'it\' needs to solve the problem, without knowing what the problem is. As soon as she finds out the game is over. \nAs a variation, bring the object back to the shop where it was purchased. Shopkeeper should give hints as to what the object is. \nInstead of an object, use an animal that is sick, dead or does not do what was promised. Like a parrot that refuse to speak - Also known as Veterinarian Endowment. \n \nInvert it - have the shopkeeper guess what it is.</item>
        <item name="Virus">Use one empty plastic soft drink bottle. Whichever player has the bottle is the virus. The virus can move around and infect other players, but only the player with the bottle can infect new players. All infected players chase the healthy players, till all are infected. Evidently, the infected payers need to pass the bottle around in order to be able to infect new players.</item>
        <item name="VoicesFromHeaven">Excellent game for building characters and group-storytelling. \n4 players, ask the audience who they are, what their occupation would be. \n \nThese 4 characters have died together, and they are going to tell us how that came about. Players line up. The game is played in 3 rounds. In every round, each player offers some information about how they happened to die. At the end of the thirds round, they should all be dead. \n \nIt\'s fun to take risks - if in the first round each of the players just offers what they happened to be doing the day they died, and where. It is quite a challenge to get these 4 stories together, including the deaths of all characters, by the end of the third round. Also known as Death Con. \nSee also Goon River for a more open, more free Long Form version of the same Handle.</item>
        <item name="WalkingByNumbers">Every player finds himself a spot in the room, make sure players can see each other. When you give a sign, exactly 1 person starts walking. Whenever that person halts, one person, and only one person starts walking. \nGradually increase the number of walkers. See also Group Freeze.</item>
        <item name="Walkout">You need at least 3 players for this one. Give each player a word. Start playing a scene with 2 players. As soon as a player hears her word, she has to leave the scene. As soon as she hear her word again, she needs to walk into the scene again. Walkouts and re-entrances need to be justified. \nAlso known as Exit Game.</item>
        <item name="WalkoverAssociation">Another way of playing association games. Place all players at one end of the room. Ask them to name, for themselves, all the things they think of when you throw them the word \'Banana\' (or anything else). \nFor every word they come up with they can take a step. They should keep thinking of stuff until they reach the other side of the room. Then throw them another word. \n \nWatch for players that take unreasonably big steps. Ask them if they are afraid they will run out of ideas. \nAs a variation, you can combine this with Last Letter.</item>
        <item name="Warehouse">Let the players walk around leisurely. Tell them they are in a big warehouse, with lots of shelves and cabinets, packed with junk. \nLet the players reach out, take something from an shelve, and name it. Players should not preconceive, just open their hands and mime taking something from a shelf, and see what it becomes. Once they\'ve named it for themselves, they place the object back, move on to another shelf and pick up something else. \n \nIf players find this difficult, have them play Presents first. \nSee also Open Your Hand.</item>
        <item name="WhatHappensNext">One player in the middle, the others sit aside. Any person can give the middle player a task, which she performs, and then she asks \'What happens next\' ? Any player may suggest what needs to happen next, but the idea is for the group to construct a coherent story. \nThe player in the middle should only and strictly be doing what she\'s told; it is up to the players at the side to construct the story. \nAlso known as And Then.</item>
        <item name="WhatHasChanged">Played in pairs. One player observes another closely. Then she closes her eyes, and her partner changes three things in his appearance. She open her eyes again and tries to discover what has changed.</item>
        <item name="WhatAreYouDoing">This is really a Dissociation game, but fun to play. \nEveryone at one end of the room, form a long line. The first player of the line steps into the room and starts miming an activity. As soon as the activity is clear, player 2 approaches player 1 and asks \'What are you doing\'. \n \nThe first player answers something that has nothing to do with what he\'s actually doing. E.g. if player 1 is cutting someone\'s hair, when asked what he\'s doing he might say I\'m reading the newspaper. \n \nFirst player moves away, and the second player starts miming the activity stated by the previous player. A third player comes up to player 2, asks what he is doing, and so on. \n \nPlay until everyone has mimed something, and has answered the question. \n \nAs a variation, you can also play this at super high speed, with 2 players. We mean super-super high speed. As soon as one of the players says ummm, hesitates, or uses an noffer that was used before in that session, that player is replaced. Great for warm-up and energy! \nOther dissociation games are Malapropism and Dissociation.</item>
        <item name="WhatWouldSheBeIf">Choose one player and let her stand in front of the class. Then ask the whole class to think what she would be if she were a car, a flower, a building, a era, a foreign country, a mineral, a beverage, your name it. \nTell the group there are no wrong answers. You may want to ask players what triggered their responses - the answers will probably vary widely. \nIf you are doing a series of workshops, it may also be interesting to play this game early on, before people know each other, and then again after a couple of weeks, when everyone has gotten to know everyone a bit better. See if the answers are any different.</item>
        <item name="WhoWhereWhyAmI">One player leaves the room. The audience provides: \nwhere we are, and when (what era) \nwho the player will be (can be a person, or just his occupation) \na physical handicap for the player (perhaps he\'s blind ?) \na problem the player has \nThen a scene is played, in which the other players need to coach player 1 into guessing each of the items above, without giving any explicit clues. Example: scene is played on the Red Square in Moscow, in 2050, where a limping salesman of vacuum cleaners never sells any vacuum cleaners, since his prices are quoted in rubels instead of Euros (Russia is obviously part of the Eurodollar zone in 2050). \nSee also Hijacker.</item>
        <item name="Whoosh">Everybody in a circle. Start with one person, who waves both hands to his/her neighbor, saying \'Whoosh\'. The next person passes the Whoosh to his neighbor, and that way the Whoosh is passed around the circle. n \nThere\'s 4 other sounds/movements that can be made. \n \n\'Wow\': indicated by saying Wow, and moving both arms down. A Wow changes the direction of the Whoosh \n\'Zap\': instead of passing the Whoosh to your neighbor, it gets zapped to the person you point to. The receiver continues with either a Whoosh to his neighbor, or another Zap to another person. A Wow after a Zap returns to the Zapper. \n\'Groooooooovelicious\': for this one the whole group bends down and up again in a kinda groovy way, all saying Groooooooovelicious. Afterwards, the person who started the Groovelicious sets the Whoosh in motion again, in any direction. \n\'Freakout\': indicated by waving both hands in the air. Everybody starts screaming and moves to the center of the circle. When everybody\'s freaked out a new circle is formed, and the starter of the Freakout sets the Whoosh in motion again (or Zaps, or does a Grooooooovelicious). \nAs a variation, you can invent other sounds and gestures. You might replace Whoosh by a kind of Vroom-Vroom, as is you\'re in a car, and replace Wow by the sounds of brakes (\'iiiii\') etc. Also known as Zip Zap Zoop.</item>
        <item name="WhoStoleTheCookies">Classic game to learn each other\'s names. Group (sings in a rhythm): Who stole the cookies from the cookie jar? \n(player who is it inserts name of player) stole the cookies from the cookie jar! \nPlayer: Who, me!?!?! \nGroup: Yes, you! \nPlayer: Couldn\'t be! \nGroup: Then who? \n(Player uses another player\'s name) stole the cookies from the cookie jar!</item>
        <item name="WithoutSound">A scene in played, in which no talk of no sounds are allowed. \nSee also Without Words</item>
        <item name="WithoutWords">A scene is played, in which the players are not allowed to talk. Sounds, like slamming doors, running water, singing birds, echoing footsteps are allowed. \nSee also Without Sound.</item>
        <item name="WordBall">Another association game. All players in a circle. One player starts by tossing a word to another player. The receiver associates on this word, and throws his association to yet another player. \nAs a variation, try this in combination with Last Letter or Free Association Lines \nInstead of just tossing word, have the players throw a soft ball, or a towel tied in a knot to each other \ntry with multiple \'tossers\' at once.</item>
        <item name="WordAtATimeExpert">3 players: one is the interviewer, and the other 2 are an expert on a subject chosen by the audience. The expert is really one person, with 2 heads, and answers to the interviewer\'s question are provided word by word, one word at a time per player. \nAlso known as Two-headed Professor. Also known as Oracle. ; use an ancient Greek oracle instead of an expert, and have the audience ask the oracle questions about life and love. \n \nAs a variation, the interviewer can raise the stakes, e.g. by pimping the expert into a Word at a Time Song.</item>
        <item name="WordAtATimeLetter">Play in pairs. The 2 players will compose a letter, one word at a time. Have them actually write down the letter. Anything, even \'where\' on the paper one starts writing, is an offer. \nNo need to sidecoach, but the possibilities are endless; thing about greeting cards, love letters, legal stuff, promotional letters, suicide notes, etc.</item>
        <item name="WordAtATimeScene">This is like Word at a Time Expert, but with a bit more scene work. 2 players, speaking one word at a time, alternating between the players. The scene is starting by stating who they are, or where they are. Example: We-are-on-a-sunny-beach. The players then actually play that, and build a story, word at a time, and actually playing the story at the same time. \nFor example: We-see-a-dead-whale; the players should actually see the whale, and do something with it. There is no need to \'say\' everything before doing it ( use our motto: Play it, don\'t say it). \n \nPlayers have an adventure together; the story needs to happen to both of them, they are not to play against each other. \nAs many players tend to verbosity, use a director that \'cuts\' the scene and tells the players what to do. Example: Give the whale mouth-to-mouth. \n \nAs a variation, allow a third character to enter the scene, playing against the two others. Now the lines are done word per word, by 3 players, but we have 2 characters. This gets extremely silly/messy - to create some order out of this chaos make sure the third player (i.e. the second character) has a different voice (different accent or pitch). Unlikely to produce interesting stories, but quite hilarious. Also known as Ping Pong.</item>
        <item name="WordAtATimeSong">This is like Word at a Time Scene, but here the players improvise a song. Song can be sung to a known melody (makes things a bit easier), or on a tune played on the piano. Tell the piano player not to play too fast, though.</item>
        <item name="WordAtATimeStory">This is an exercise to train group narrative. All players sit in a circle. We are going to tell a story one word at a time. Each player provides one word of a sentence. End of a sentence can be indicates by a player saying \'period\', although that is not necessary. \nThis is more difficult than it sounds, especially with newbies. If you\'re working with novice players have them try a familiar story. like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs first. Summarize the story before they get started, to make sure they\'re all on the same story. Don\'t be surprised if gagsters manage to smuggle atomic bombs and crashing aircraft into the story. Ask the group if they can see/understand the reasons why their story sucks. n \nYou can also play this a challenge with newbies: divide the group into 2 circles, and have them compete each other - see which group can finish the story first.</item>
        <item name="WordAtATimeProverb">Players in a circle. One player starts with first word of a (non-existing) proverb; circle continues, one word at a time, until the group \'feels\' the proverb is done; at that point everybody says \'yes, yes, yes, yes\'. \nHint: start with (a) typical proverb word(s), like \'A\', \'He who\', etc.</item>
        <item name="WorldsWorst">Not exactly theater, but fun if played well. \nPlayers line up, and the audience provides verbs, hobbies and occupations. The players need to come up with the worst possible way of doing/being what the audience suggests.</item>
        <item name="YesLets">Excellent warm-up, and great introduction to Accepting. \nPick a group activity, like throwing a party or organizing a picnic. One player starts, saying Let\'s.. filling in what she wants to do. Then she starts actually doing what she said she wanted to do. A second player jumps in, saying Let\'s.. do something else, to advance the group activity. Both players say Yes, let\'s do that and start doing whatever suggested. Third player jumps in, suggests what to do, and again all players loudly agree to do it, and actually do it. Continue till everyone has suggested something. \n \nSee also Yes Lets - or Rather Not for a more advanced version of this exercise. \n \nIf the setup is invent an advertising campaign for an unknown/imaginary product then this game is also know as Also known as The Ad Game.</item>
        <item name="YesLetsOrRatherNot">This is a bit controversial, and you probably don\'t want to do this with newbies. \nThis one goes a bit like Yes Lets : all players on stage, someone provides a location, e.g. a beach. One player suggests an action. All players that like the action yell \'Yes, Let\'s do that\' and start doing it. Whoever does not like the suggestion steps out sits down. Game continues till only one player is left. \n \nThis one is a bit controversial as players will object that (one of) the main ideas in Improv is to accept, and in this game one can reject a suggestion. \nThe idea behind this exercise is that we want our players to be Mr. Nice Guy - players should try to make their co-players happy. The problem is to learn what suggestions are \'good\', which suggestions make our other players happy. And that\'s what we\'re trying to learn with this exercise. \n \nAttitude is important for this one: \n \nplayers should not feel inhibited to step out (i.e. they should not feel that they are not accepting \nplayers should not feel rejected when others step out. Be happy about that - you are learning which suggestions make others happy! (see Chivalry ).</item>
        <item name="You">Everyone in a circle. Everyone raises their right hand. The 1st person points to someone in the circle with their hand up and says you. They do the same until everyone\'s hand is down, and the last person has pointed back to the 1st person, thus completing the circle. Important: This is a pattern that never changes. Repeat the pattern until it feels comfortable. Then switch places in the circle. Repeat the pattern. Close your eyes, and repeat the pattern. \n \nWhen everyone is comfortable with that, everyone raises their hand again. The same 1st person begins. Name something: a favorite tv show, food, whatever. Don\'t point to the same person that you did last time. Once you feel comfortable with this pattern, you begin both. Start with you and add the next level. (Ex: you, you, you, string beans, you, corn, pizza, you, etc.).\n\n\n\nIf you feel that this is becoming too easy, add a third pattern, switch places in the circle, close your eyes.\n\n\n\nAs a variation, more of a challenge, start two patterns, and then add the pattern of pointing to someone, and saying the name of the person to your right. Once that pattern is established, switch places in the circle.\n\n\n\nEven more complicated: make another pattern by pointing at players. Once the pattern is established, players in turn take the next player\'s position in the circle; every time someone takes a player\'s position, that player walks to his next person and takes that position. Repeat this while passing the other patterns.</item>
        <item name="YoureFired">This is a scene with 2 players, in which the lines are scripted. Here\'s the script: \n(1) {Knocks on a door} \n(2) Come in. You know why I called you? \n(1) {Indicates she does not know why} n \n(2) {Hands 1 a (mimed) piece of paper} \n(1) I thought you wouldn\'t take that into account? \n(2) You\'re fired. \n(1) Fine. I hated that stupid job anyway. \nHave the players play that scene. They need to stick to the script, but can really do anything as long as they don\'t add any lines. It probably won\'t be all that interesting. \n \nThen make them replay the scene, but give them a side coaching (which the other player and the audience or the rest of the group don\'t hear). See if the scenes become any more interesting. Things you might give a player could be \n \nYou\'re nervous, happy, sad, afraid of the other \nThe other smells nice/stinks \nYou\'ve been eating beans/garlic \nYou turn into a crow/monkey/cow \nYou are in a wheelchair \nYou try to make a pass at the other \nYour underwear doesn\'t quite fit (too small) \nYou are a bit deaf, you can\'t find your glasses, you loose a contact, loose your dentures \nYou are a kleptomaniac \nPlayers can do quite a lot without deviating from the script. They can build/open doors, windows, cabinets, make all kinds of noises or faces. \nRemind players they can switch status. Perhaps they could try and make clear what\'s on the note? Is it bad, or petty, or funny, or sad? \n \nAs a variation, feel free to come up with a different scene, with different lines. \nSee also Fast Food Stanislawski.</item>
        <item name="Zapping">4 players, each chooses a TV format, like the News, a documentary, a Pokemon show, you name it. The audience provides a central theme, and the MC will \'zap\' through the channels. Miraculously, all broadcasts cover the same theme.</item>
        <item name="ZipZapZoop">Everybody in a circle. Start with one person, who waves both hands to his/her neighbor, saying \'Whoosh\'. The next person passes the Whoosh to his neighbor, and that way the Whoosh is passed around the circle. \nThere\'s 4 other sounds/movements that can be made. \n \n\'Wow\': indicated by saying Wow, and moving both arms down. A Wow changes the direction of the Whoosh \n\'Zap\': instead of passing the Whoosh to your neighbor, it gets zapped to the person you point to. The receiver continues with either a Whoosh to his neighbor, or another Zap to another person. A Wow after a Zap returns to the Zapper. \n\'Groooooooovelicious\': for this one the whole group bends down and up again in a kinda groovy way, all saying Groooooooovelicious. Afterwards, the person who started the Groovelicious sets the Whoosh in motion again, in any direction. \n\'Freakout\': indicated by waving both hands in the air. Everybody starts screaming and moves to the center of the circle. When everybody\'s freaked out a new circle is formed, and the starter of the Freakout sets the Whoosh in motion again (or Zaps, or does a Grooooooovelicious). \nAs a variation, you can invent other sounds and gestures. You might replace Whoosh by a kind of Vroom-Vroom, as is you\'re in a car, and replace Wow by the sounds of brakes (\'iiiii\') etc. Also known as Whoosh.</item>
        <item name="ZombieNameGame">Great game to get to know each other. All about the room, one player is the zombie; she moves, zombie-style, arms stretched out in front of her, towards one player. Before she reaches that player, he needs to yell the name of another player, and the zombie heads towards that player. If the zombie reaches a player before he yells another name, that player becomes the zombie.</item>
        <item name="ZoomInZoomOut">A scene is played; at any time the MC or host calls zoom-out - at that point, the scene continues, but is played with finger puppets (as if the audience is watching the scene from far away, and all characters are finger-sized). This continues until the host calls zoom-in, after which the scene continues in normal size. Alter between zoom-in and zoom-out ad libitum.</item>
        <item name="Zulu1">All players form a line, facing the audience. Audience suggests a general product category, like soup or family cars. Players then have to come up with original new names for (new) products in that category. \nAs a variation, there is another game named Zulu - see Zulu(2).</item>
        <item name="Zulu2">All players form a line, facing the audience. Audience suggests a general product category, like soup or family cars or candy bars. \nThe MC now points to a player, who needs to keep coming up with original names for a product of that category. No doubles are allowed, neither are existing brand names. A player that makes a mistake \'dies\' ( when the audience yells \'Die\'). The MC can switch players at any time, and the game lasts till there is only one player left. \n \nAs a variation, there is another game named Zulu - see Zulu(1).</item>
